Biden calls for ban on gun used to shoot Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1x4xjvrgdo#0,"The US president resumes his campaign with criticism of Donald Trump and says the weapon used against him should be ""outlawed"".","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 13:46:13 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.585165,"[""Joe Biden has renewed a call for Congress to ban assault rifles, including the model that was used in the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Trump's ear was grazed by a bullet after a gunman shot at him from a nearby rooftop during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.“An AR-15 was used in the shooting of Donald Trump. This was the assault weapon that killed so many others, including children. It’s time to outlaw them,” Mr Biden told the audience at a convention in Las Vegas.His demand came as he returned to the campaign trail for the first time since the attack. "", ""Biden urges America to 'lower temperature' after Trump shootingIn maps: Donald Trump assassination attempt"", 'For several days following the shooting, the Biden campaign had been on pause. Verbal attacks had been halted, television ads pulled and a message of unity was pushed by many prominent Democrats.Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Biden continued in that vein, lamenting how “heated” politics has become. But later in his speech - an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP), a prominent civil rights group - he went on to roundly criticise Trump.“Just because our politics are very divided doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth. Who you are, what you’ve done, what you will do - that’s fair game,” he said.""Let me say it again because Trump is lying like hell about it,” he told the conference hall of primarily black voters. “Black unemployment hit a record low under the Biden-Harris administration,"" the president added. Statistics show that his government reached the record low unemployment rate for Black or African Americans in 2023, at 4.8%.Gun rights are an issue Mr Biden has frequently campaigned on.In 1994, he was instrumental in passing an assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004. He referenced that legislation during his speech, saying ""I\'ve done it before, I\'ll do it again"". In 2022, during his first term as president, Mr Biden signed into law the most significant gun safety legislation in more than two decades, which included enhanced background checks for gun buyers and other protections.But he has repeatedly come up against strong opposition from Republicans to an assault weapons ban.The president\'s return to the campaign trail came as the Republican National Convention (RNC) closed out its second day on Tuesday, with a line-up of speakers - including former presidential nominee rivals Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis - roundly uniting behind Trump.At a side event hosted by the gun rights group, US Concealed Carry Association, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign said Donald Trump would safeguard gun rights by appointing pro-gun judges if he is elected in November.""We\'ll see a continuation of supporting and defending the Second Amendment, and really where that comes into play is the judiciary,"" Chris LaCivita told attendees, according to Reuters news agency.Donald Trump has already said that he would unravel all of Mr Biden’s new gun rules if elected in November, a stance that shows no sign of changing even following Saturday’s attempt on his life.Authorities are yet to land on the motive of gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was able to shoot at Trump after climbing onto the roof of a building 130m (426ft) from where he was speaking.An independent review of the Secret Service’s handling of the shooting is underway and Republican leaders in Congress have also announced an investigation.']"
Cyanide found in blood of Bangkok hotel victims,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g64ljwp2go#0,Police suspect that one of the dead was behind the poisoning and was driven by crushing debt.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 14:21:38 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.585437,"['Cyanide has been found in the blood of all six people who died in a luxury hotel suite in Bangkok, say doctors after examining their bodies.Based on the initial post-mortem examination, they say there is ""no other cause"" that would explain their deaths ""except for cyanide"". But further tests are being carried out to determine the ""intensity"" of the deadly chemical and to rule out any other toxins.Forensic investigators had earlier found traces of cyanide on the teacups used by the victims, all of whom are of Vietnamese origin including two with dual US citizenship. Police suspect that one of the dead was behind the poisoning and was driven by crushing debt - but have not said who.The victims\' lips and nails had turned dark purple indicating a lack of oxygen, while their internal organs turned ""blood red"", which is another sign of cyanide poisoning, said Professor Kornkiat Vongpaisarnsin of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Chulalongkorn University.Doctor Chanchai Sittipunt, the dean of the Faculty of Medicine, said they still needed to find out how much cyanide was in the blood of the deceased.""But from what we have detected - from observation, from internal organ check, from finding cyanide in the blood during the screening test - there is no other cause that would be the factor that would cause their deaths, except for cyanide,” he told reporters.The deceased were found by housekeepers at the Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel in the Thai capital late on Tuesday.Investigators believe they had been dead for between 12 and 24 hours by then. The mystery around the shocking discovery made international headlines. Thailand\'s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin ordered an urgent investigation into the case, stressing that the deaths were the result of a ""private matter"", and there was no suggestion of public danger. Police have since begun to piece together what might have happened. Two of the six victims had loaned ""tens of millions of Thai baht"" to another of the deceased for investment purposes, authorities said. Ten million baht is worth nearly $280,000 (£215,000).', 'Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Bangkok police chief Gen Noppassin Poonsawat told a press conference the group checked into the hotel separately over the weekend and were assigned five rooms - four on the seventh floor, and one on the fifth. They had been scheduled to check out on Monday but failed to do so.Four of the victims are Vietnamese nationals Thi Nguyen Phuong, 46, her husband Hong Pham Thanh, 49, Thi Nguyen Phuong Lan, 47,  and Dinh Tran Phu, 37.The other two are American citizens Sherine Chong, 56, and Dang Hung Van, 55.The US state department has offered its condolences and said it is ""closely monitoring"" the situation. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting Thai authorities in the investigation, Mr Srettha said.', 'The motive is not clear, but police said two of the six had loaned a substantial amount of money to another person in the group, who had not been paid back.Police say on Monday afternoon all six victims gathered in the room on the fifth floor. The group ordered food and tea, which was delivered to the room around 14:00 local time (08:00 BST) and received by Ms Chong - who was the only person in the room at the time. According to the deputy police chief, a waiter offered to make tea for the guests but Ms Chong refused this. The waiter recalled that she “spoke very little and was visibly under stress”, authorities said.The waiter later left the room. The rest of the group then began streaming into the room at various points, between 14:03 and 14:17. No one else is believed to have entered the room apart from the six inside and police have said the door to the room was locked from within. ', 'Police say there were no signs of a struggle, robbery or forced entry. They later found traces of cyanide in all six tea cups.Pictures released by the police show plates of untouched food left on a table in the room, some of them still covered in cling wrap. There was a seventh name on the group\'s hotel booking, whom police identified as the younger sister of one of the victims. She had left Thailand last week for the Vietnamese coastal city of Da Nang and is not involved in the incident, police said. Relatives interviewed by the police said Thi Nguyen Phuong and Hong Pham Thanh, a couple, owned a road construction business and had given money to Ms Chong to invest in a hospital building project in Japan.Police suspect that Mr Tran, a make-up artist based in Da Nang, had also been “duped"" into making an investment. Mr Tran\'s mother Tuý told BBC Vietnamese that he had travelled to Thailand on Friday and had called home on Sunday to say he had to extend his stay until Monday. That was the last his family had heard from him. She rang him again on Monday but he did not answer the call. Ms Chong had hired Mr Tran as her personal make-up artist for the trip, one of his students told BBC Vietnamese. Mr Tran\'s father, Phu, told Vietnamese media that his son was hired last week by a Vietnamese woman to travel to Thailand.  The six bodies were discovered one day after Thailand expanded its visa-free entry scheme to travellers from 93 countries and territories to revitalise its tourism industry. ', ""Cyanide is a rapidly-acting, highly toxic chemical that is potentially deadly. Low levels of cyanide occur in nature and in products we eat and use. But in larger doses it is a notorious poison, and has been used as a chemical warfare agent because of its fast-acting and highly lethal properties.It can occur as a colourless gas or liquid or in crystal form. People can be exposed to cyanide by breathing it in, absorbing it through the skin, or eating food or liquids that contain it.When consumed in large amounts, cyanide can lead to lung injury, coma and death within seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Even in smaller doses, cyanide is still very harmful, causing chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath and vomiting.Cyanide can produce a “bitter almond” smell but not everyone can detect this and it doesn’t always give off an odour.Additional reporting by BBC Thai and BBC Vietnamese's Thuong Le""]"
"Hamas committed war crimes on 7 October, says Human Rights Watch",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vdz75g6dvo#0,"Hamas rejects what it calls the ""lies"" in HRW's report about the deadly attack on Israel that it led.","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:44:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.585644,"[""Hamas and at least four other Palestinian armed groups committed numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity against civilians during the 7 October attack on southern Israel, the campaign group Human Rights Watch says.A new report accuses the hundreds of gunmen who breached the Gaza border fence of violations including deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, wilful killing of persons in custody, sexual and gender-based violence, hostage-taking, mutilation of bodies and looting.It also found the killing of civilians and hostage-taking were “central aims of the planned attack” and not an “afterthought”.Hamas angrily rejected what it called HRW’s “lies” and demanded an apology.About 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others were taken as hostages when 26 Israeli communities and towns, as well as number of military bases, two music festivals and a beach party were attacked nine months ago.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza with the aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages.More than 38,790 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.HRW's report does not cover alleged violations of the laws of war by Israeli forces and Palestinian groups in the conflict that was triggered by the 7 October attack."", 'The report released by HRW on Wednesday is based on interviews with 144 people, including witnesses to the 7 October attack, as well as analysis of more than 280 photographs and videos posted on social media or shared with the group’s researchers.“Across many attack sites, [Palestinian] fighters fired directly at civilians, often at close range, as they tried to flee, and at people who happened to be driving vehicles in the area,” it says.“They hurled grenades and shot into safe rooms and other shelters and fired rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) at homes. They set some houses on fire, burning and suffocating people to death, and forcing out others who they then captured or killed,” it adds.“They took hundreds hostage for transfer to Gaza or summarily killed them.”Hamas’s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, led the assault, but HRW says it has strong evidence of the participation of at least four other Palestinian armed groups, based on headbands the gunmen wore and their claims posted on social media:al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)Omar al-Qasim Forces, the armed wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, the armed wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, which is linked to the Fatah movementThe BBC has previously reported that they took part in military-style exercises with Hamas from 2020 onwards which closely resembled the tactics used on 7 October. ', 'HRW’s report concludes that the Palestinian groups committed a widespread and systematic attack directed against a civilian population, which amounts to a crime against humanity, based on the numerous civilian sites that were targeted and “the planning that went into the crimes”.It also found that the killing of civilians and the taking of hostages were “all central aims of the planned attack, and not actions that occurred as an afterthought, or as a plan gone awry, or as isolated acts, for example solely by the actions of unaffiliated Palestinians from Gaza, and as such, there is strong evidence of an organisational policy to commit multiple acts of crimes against humanity”.The report says further investigation is needed into other potential crimes against humanity, including persecution against any identifiable group on racial, national, ethnic or religious grounds; rape or sexual violence of comparable gravity; and extermination, if there was a mass killing calculated to bring about the “destruction” of part of a population.The report includes a letter from Hamas responding to the allegations, in which the group said it was “committed to respecting international law” and that the al-Qassam Brigades “was clear in directing its members and fighters not to target civilians”.Hamas also said the participation of unaffiliated Palestinians from Gaza and other armed groups not involved in the initial, planned assault led to “chaos in the field”, a change in “the plan to conduct an operation against military targets” and “the occurrence of many mistakes”.The report says HRW found Hamas’s claim that its forces did not seek to harm Israeli civilians was “false”, noting that photos and videos showed gunmen seeking out civilians and killing them at various sites from the first moments of the attack.In a statement issued following the report’s publication, Hamas said: “We reject the lies and blatant bias towards the occupation [Israel] and the lack of professionalism and credibility in the Human Rights Watch report. We demand its withdrawal and an apology.”In a separate report in April, HRW said an Israeli air strike on a residential building in central Gaza on 31 October that killed 106 people constituted a war crime. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and accuses Hamas of operating in civilian structures.The group has also accused the Israeli government of using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, which is a war crime. Israel says it facilitates deliveries of humanitarian aid and is not to blame for Gaza’s food shortages.In May, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) applied for arrest warrants for Hamas’s Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, military chief Mohammed Deif and political leader Ismail Haniyeh for crimes against humanity and war crimes from 7 October onwards. He also sought warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Both Hamas and Israel reacted with outrage to the announcement.']"

The original is kept in the nearby Bargello museum.The photos sparked angry reactions from social media users, some of whom called for the woman\'s arrest.""This is the result of years of attempts at turning Florence into Disneyland,"" said another.Patrizia Asproni, the president of Confcultura, an association that promotes Italy\'s cultural heritage, told Italian media that these ""repeated shows of rudeness and barbarity"" take place ""because everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want with impunity"".Ms Asproni called for the application of the ""Singapore model"" with ""tight checks, sky-high fines and zero tolerance"" for bad behaviour.Antonella Rinaldi, Florence\'s archaeology and fine arts superintendent, said: ""Tourists are welcome here but they need to respect our artworks, be they originals or replicas.""""Although I doubt this lady - whom I condemn - even knows the difference,"" she added.Florence is one of the world\'s foremost tourist destinations. In 2023, around 1.5 million people visited the city - which has a population of just 382,000 - between June and September.Local residents have long struggled with the huge influx of tourists, which in the summer months turns Florence\'s narrow streets into steady streams of people. The so-called ""overtourism"" phenomenon has prompted several cities around the world to make changes to the way they welcome tourists. Last month, the mayor of Barcelona pledged to eliminate short-term tourist lets in the city within five years, while several hotspots - like Venice or Japan\'s Mount Fuji - have started to introduce daily charges to try to limit numbers.']"
Trump's defeated Republican rivals show united front at convention,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd0gn6nel6o#0,"Several of the former president's past challengers, including Nikki Haley, voiced full support for his candidacy.","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 03:56:22 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.586038,"['One by one, Donald Trump’s defeated rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination took the stage to sing his praises at the party\'s convention on Tuesday night.From his box just above the convention floor, Trump smiled at times as he watched his former opponents Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy voice their full support for his candidacy.If there were any doubts that this was Trump’s party, Tuesday’s programming put them to rest.“I’ll start by making one thing perfectly clear: Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,” said Ms Haley, the former UN Ambassador who posed the strongest challenge to Trump earlier this year.She said Trump had asked her to speak at the event in Milwaukee in the name of “unity"".“For the sake of our nation we have to go with Donald Trump,” she told the crowd.Ms Haley said in May that she would vote for the former president, but her headline speech on Tuesday was her most direct endorsement of the Republican nominee yet.And when she declared her endorsement, Trump stood and clapped.Ms Haley’s arrival, however, was not universally welcomed in the arena. There was a noticeable intake of breath as she acknowledged that she and Trump had their differences.Some Republicans have struggled to forgive her for launching an aggressive campaign against their favoured candidate. Late in the race, she questioned whether Trump had the mental stamina to serve as president.A smattering of boos greeted her as she took the podium, though they were soon drowned out by cheers and chants.She deserves the booing, said Gregory Switzer, a conservative activist from Texas.“She stayed in that race a lot longer than she needed to and dragged out the inevitable,"" said Matt Bumela, a delegate from Washington state who had predicted the booing. “And said things about Trump that were negative all the way up to the end.”', 'Ms Haley notably broke from Trump when she called for the US to continue to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.When she later said she would vote for him in November, she said the former president would be “smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me"".On Tuesday night, she told supporters of hers who might be on the fence: “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him – take it from me.”“Tonight is our unity night,” said New Hampshire state Senator William Gannon, who had served as a delegate for Ms Haley. He believed Trump made the right choice to invite her to speak.“I wanna win the national election,” he said. “It was a wise move to bring her in.”The third-place finisher in the primary, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, received a far more enthusiastic welcome from the crowd.He touched on several conservative social issues, including diversity initiatives, which he said were “indoctrination”.He urged the crowd to rally behind Trump – though they were already solidly behind their current nominee. “We cannot let him down, and we cannot let America down,” Mr DeSantis said.He also took a swipe at Mr Biden’s age, an issue that is currently roiling the Democratic Party. “We need a commander-in-chief who can lead 24 hours a day and seven days a week,” he said.Daniel Willis, the 25-year-old chair of the Delaware Young Republicans, said Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley did more than enough “to bridge the gap” with Trump supporters.LISTEN: Americast discusses the Republican rivals reunitedLara Trump, Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, hit a conciliatory tone, telling the crowd: “You don’t have to admit that you like everything that he tweets, but Americans were better off when he was in office.”She added: “Last Saturday reminded us that we Americans must remember that there is more that unites us than divides us.""The rest of the night was devoted to the more common Republican campaign points, such as migrant crossings at the border, crime and an overarching commitment to defeating Mr Biden.Ted Cruz, the US senator from Texas, said there was a “literal invasion” of the United States. Dr Ben Carson, who served in Trump\'s cabinet, accused Democrats of “shredding the Constitution"".Trump himself led a huge standing ovation for Madeline Brame, a woman whose son was killed in New York in 2018 and has since called for tough-on-crime policies.Down on the floor, delegates said they were ready to move beyond the intra-party divisions of the primary and instead focus the party’s energy on President Biden.“At the end of the day,” said Georgia delegate Pam Lightsey, “We’re all Republicans.”']"
Ex-CIA analyst charged with spying for South Korea,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5qd82pjlo#0,"Sue Mi Terry is accused of helping South Korea in exchange for cash, luxury bags, fancy meals and expensive clothes.

Sue Mi Terry, who previously worked as a senior official for the White House National Security Council, faces two counts of failing to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Federal officials say Ms Terry - a prominent US expert on North Korea - acted as an agent for the South Korean government for over a decade, but she did not register as a foreign agent with American officials, according to court documents made public on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York.The Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank where Ms Terry works as a senior fellow on Asia, has placed her on unpaid leave, a spokesperson told US outlets. The organisation has also removed her biography from its website. Ms Terry, 54, denies the charges and her attorney, Lee Wolosky, told the BBC the allegations against her were ""unfounded"".The charges ""distort the work of a scholar and news analyst known for her independence and years of service to the United States"", Mr Wolosky said. ""In fact, she was a harsh critic of the South Korean government during times this indictment alleges that she was acting on its behalf.""Born in South Korea, Ms Terry moved to the US at age 12, according to her previous employer at Columbia University. In 2001, she earned her doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, a prominent international relations school in Massachusetts. She is known to lecture in English and Korean.Ms Terry, 54, then went on to work as a senior analyst for the CIA from 2001 to 2008, before holding a variety of posts in the federal government, including as Director for Korea, Japan, and Oceanic Affairs at the National Security Council during the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Prosecutors say Ms Terry\'s work as an agent for the South Korean government began in 2013, about five years, after she stopped working for the CIA and the National Security Council. In the 31-page indictment, officials say Ms Terry admitted to FBI agents in a voluntary interview in 2023 that she was a “source” for South Korea’s National Intelligence Service. The indictment alleges that the South Korean government gifted Ms Terry a $2,845 (£2,100) Dolce & Gabbana coat, a $3,450 Louis Vuitton handbag and meals at upscale restaurants.Officials say the government also gave her $37,000 and came up with a plan to hide the source of the funds, ultimately placing them in a gift fund at the think tank where she worked. Ms Terry\'s indictment comes just a day after Democratic Senator Robert Menendez was convicted of helping foreign governments in exchange for luxury items including gold bars and a Mercedes car. ']"

Since losing her appeal against the ban, she has thrown her weight behind Edmundo González and campaigned on his behalf, criss-crossing the country and encouraging voters to unite behind him in order to defeat Mr Maduro at the polls. Dozens of members of her campaign team have been arrested, with some accused of involvement in anti-government conspiracies. ', 'Restaurant and food stall owners have also complained about their businesses being closed down by officials after they served the opposition leaders.The government alleges that the businesses were shuttered because their paperwork was not in order.The non-governmental organisation Foro Penal, which keeps a tally of what it says are political prisoners, said more than 100 people linked to the opposition had been detained in the run-up to the presidential election.Foro Penal said that the high number of arrests was a clear indication of  ""a systematic scheme"" to restrict the rights of Venezuelan citizens.Opinion polls give Edmundo González a huge lead over President Maduro, but many in the opposition fear the election result may be tampered with.The 2018 election in which Mr Maduro was re-elected to a second term was widely dismissed as being neither free nor fair. The opposition coalition led by Ms Machado is urging its supporters to turn out to vote despite these concerns, arguing that overwhelming support for their unity candidate will make it harder for any fraud to take place.']"
Trump's choice of running mate raises fears in Ukraine and EU,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727zvgvv8ko#1,Diplomats and politicians voice concern over JD Vance's repeated criticism of US aid to Ukraine.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 19:44:20 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.586730,"['European politicians and diplomats had already prepared for changes to their relationship with the US in the event of a second Donald Trump presidency.Now that the Republican candidate has chosen Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, those differences appear even more stark on prospects for the war in Ukraine, security and trade.A vocal critic of US aid to Ukraine, Mr Vance told this year’s Munich Security Conference that Europe should wake up to the US having to “pivot” its focus to East Asia. ""The American security blanket has allowed European security to atrophy,"" he said.Nils Schmid, a senior MP in German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s party, told the BBC that he was confident a Republican presidency would continue to stay within Nato, even if JD Vance came across as ""more isolationist"" and Donald Trump remained ""unpredictable"".However, he warned of a new round of ""trade wars"" with the US under a second Trump presidency.An EU diplomat said that after four years of Donald Trump no-one was naïve: ""We understand what it means if Trump comes back as a second-term president, regardless of his running mate.""Portraying the EU as a sailing boat preparing for a storm the diplomat, who preferred not to be named, added that whatever they might be able to tie down, it was always going to be rough.The US is Ukraine\'s biggest ally, and President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week: ""I\'m not afraid about him becoming president, we will work together.""', 'He also said that he believed most of the Republican party supported Ukraine and its people.Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump also have a common friend in Boris Johnson, the former UK prime minister, who has consistently championed continued aid for Ukraine and recently met the former president at the Republican National Convention.Following the meeting, Mr Johnson posted on X that he had “no doubt that [Mr Trump] will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy”.But even if that sentiment is true, it might not apply to Mr Vance, who, days before the full-scale invasion, told a podcast he “doesn’t really care what happens in Ukraine, one way or the other”. He also played a key role in delaying a $60bn military aid package from Washington.""We need to try and convince him otherwise,"" says Yevhen Mahda, the Executive Director of the Institute of World Policy think tank in Kyiv.""A fact we can use is that he fought in Iraq, therefore he should be invited to Ukraine so he can see with his own eyes what is happening and how American money is spent.""The question for Kyiv will be to what extent he can influence the decisions of his new boss.Yevhen Mahda agrees that Trump’s unpredictability could be a problem for Kyiv in the run-up to the US presidential election.The biggest supporter of the Trump-Vance ticket in the European Union is Hungary’s Viktor Orban who returned recently from a visit to see the Republican candidate, after visiting Mr Zelensky and President Putin, with whom he maintains close ties.In a letter to EU leaders, Mr Orban said a victorious Donald Trump would not even wait to be inaugurated as president before quickly demanding peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.', '""He has detailed and well-founded plans for this,"" the letter states.Mr Zelensky has himself said this week that Russia should attend a peace summit possibly next November, and he has promised a “fully ready plan”. But he made clear he had not come under Western pressure to do so.Viktor Orban\'s recent ""peace missions"" to Moscow and Beijing have sparked accusations that he’s abusing his country’s six-month rotating presidency of the European Council. European Commission officials have been told not to attend meetings in Hungary because of Mr Orban’s actions.During the Trump presidency, the US imposed tariffs on EU-produced steel and aluminium. Although they were paused under Joe Biden’s administration, Trump has since floated a 10% tariff on all overseas imports should he get back into the White House.The prospect of renewed economic confrontation with the US will be seen as a bad, even a disastrous, outcome in most European capitals.""The only thing we know for sure is there will be punitive tariffs levelled on the European Union so we have to prepare for another round of trade wars,"" said Nils Schmid, the Social Democrats’ foreign policy lead in the Bundestag.JD Vance singled out Berlin for criticism of its military preparedness earlier this year.While he didn’t mean to ""beat up"" on Germany, he said the industrial base underpinning its arms production was  insufficient.', 'This will all pile further pressure on Germany, Europe’s largest economy, to ""step up"" as a principal player in underwriting European security.After his much-lauded ""zeitenwende"" (turning point) speech in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Olaf Scholz was often accused of hesitancy on supplying weapons to Kyiv.But his allies are always keen to point out that Germany is second only to the US in terms of military aid to Kyiv while it has – for the first time since the end of the Cold War – met the 2% GDP defence spending target, albeit via short-term budgeting.""I think we are on the right track,"" said Mr Schmid. ""We have to build back an army that was neglected for 15 to 20 years.""But observers are far from convinced that behind-the-scenes European preparations are either serious or sufficient.There are few leaders with the political clout or inclination to champion the future security architecture of an unwieldy European continent.Chancellor Scholz has an understated style and clear resistance to taking a lead on bolder foreign policy positions – and faces a very real prospect of being voted out of office next year.French President Emmanuel Macron has been left a severely weakened figure after calling parliamentary elections that have left his country in a state of political paralysis.Polish President Andrzej Duda warned on Tuesday that if Ukraine loses its struggle against Russia “then Russia’s potential war with the West will be extremely imminent”.""This voracious Russian monster will want to attack on and on.""']"

Around 30 students ate the fiery snacks after one of them brought them to school on Tuesday, Japanese local media reported. Soon, some of them started complaining of nausea and acute pain around their mouth, prompting emergency calls to the fire department and police.The 13 girls and one boy who were taken to hospital were conscious and reportedly  had minor symptoms.The company that makes the snack, Isoyama Corp, put out a statement, apologising for ""any inconvenience"" to customers, and wished the students a swift recovery. The school and the company have not responded to the BBC\'s questions so far. The company website is full of warnings for those who may wish to try the crisps. It ""forbids"" those under 18 from consuming the crisps which are called  ""R 18+ curry chips"", because of how spicy they are - and it warns even those who love hot food to ""eat with caution"". The crisps are ""so spicy that they may cause you pain"", it says. The spiciness comes from the potent “ghost pepper”, cultivated in northeastern India, where it\'s known as bhut jolokia. Although it is used in recipes in India and elsewhere, it\'s known to be among the world\'s hottest chillis. The kick from your chilli can have side effectsThe Japanese firm, in fact, advises people not to ""eat the chips when they are alone” and says they could cause diarrhoea if eaten ""excessively"". Those with high blood pressure and weak stomachs ""are absolutely prohibited"" from eating the crisps, according to the company\'s website. It warns people who have cuts on their fingers to be careful while opening the packets. Those who are ""timid or too scared"" are also discouraged from trying the snack.One media report said one of the students, a boy, brought the crisps to school ""just for fun"".Responding to news about the hospitalisations, some X users posted a ""spicy meter"" to demonstrate how hot the crisps were, while others shared videos of their agonising experience of eating them. In one video, a user who appears to be wincing, described it as ""painful"" and said it reminded him of the time he had urinary stones.X owner Elon Musk also weighed in, saying ""they must be next-level spicy!""']"

And we’re going to win.”Mr Kennedy then says: “Yeah.”Trump and Mr Kennedy, a longshot third-party candidate, are political rivals who have occasionally criticised each other during the campaign.The footage is said to have been recorded on Sunday, a day before the pair met in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Republican convention is taking place, stoking speculation that Mr Kennedy might be about to exit the race and endorse Trump.But Kennedy spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said on Monday that he was not dropping out.Robert F Kennedy Jr posted on X on Tuesday: “When President Trump called me I was taping with an in-house videographer.“I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately.

Indian man stuck in lift for 42 hours thought he would die,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngwv59wq4o#1,Ravindran Nair entered a hospital lift on Saturday afternoon. He was rescued on Monday morning.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:36:15 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.588014,"['A man from the southern Indian state of Kerala, who got trapped in a hospital lift for 42 hours without any food or water, has told the BBC he feared he would die there.Ravindran Nair, 59, entered the lift to meet a doctor on Saturday afternoon - he then remained stuck inside until Monday morning, when a lift operator found him. He is now in hospital and is being treated for dehydration and back pain. His family members initially thought he was at work, but later contacted police and began a desperate search for him.The incident has made headlines, prompting the state government to suspend three technicians and launch an inquiry. Officials from the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, and the state\'s health minister have apologised to Mr Nair.Mr Nair told the BBC that when he got trapped, he tried calling the emergency number listed in the lift but there was no response. He also tried calling his wife Sreelekha CP, who works at the hospital, and ""anyone else I could think of"", but the calls wouldn\'t connect.""I began panicking and started banging on the lift doors to attract attention. That’s when my phone fell on the floor and stopped working,"" he says.""I shouted and screamed for help and tried pulling apart the doors with my hands. It was now dark inside the lift, but thankfully, there was sufficient air to breathe.""He then paced around the lift, pressing the alarm bell again and again, hoping it would ring and catch someone\'s attention - but without any success. ""As the hours passed, I had no idea whether it was day or night as it was pitch dark inside. When I got tired, I slept in a corner. I had to use another corner to pee and poo,"" he says.', 'Mr Nair said he began visiting the hospital regularly a few months ago after he fell in the bathroom and started suffering from back pain.""On Saturday, my wife and I went to meet the doctor and I got an X-ray scan done of my back because I was experiencing severe pain after a recent trip,"" he recalls. When the doctor asked to see the results from his blood test, the couple realised that they had forgotten them at home. Since Ms Sreelakha had to report for work, Mr Nair went home to pick up the results. Normally when he visits the hospital he and his wife use a lift earmarked for employees. But this time he stepped into Lift-11 - meant for patients and visitors - to head up to the second floor. ""It was just past noon then. There was no-one else in the lift but the light was on, so I didn\'t think anything was wrong,"" he says.He pressed the button and the lift began ascending but as it neared the second floor, it lurched downwards with a thud and got stuck between the first and second floors.He didn\'t know then that his ordeal would last nearly two days. At some point he remembered he had to take pills to keep his blood pressure under control. ""I had them on me, but couldn’t swallow them because I had no water and my mouth was dry from shouting for help,"" he recalls.""I started wondering whether I would die inside the lift. I worried about my wife and children and thought about my late parents and ancestors. But then, I somehow willed myself to be stronger and told myself that I had to overcome this frightening ordeal.""One thing that gave him comfort, he says, was reciting poems written by his wife. ""I held on to the hope that someone would come along to repair the lift and find me there.""Help arrived finally on Monday morning at around 06:00 local time when an operator opened the door and asked him to jump out - 42 hours after his ordeal began.Once Mr Nair was rescued, the first thing he did was call his wife, who had no idea her missing husband was trapped at her workplace.""He wanted me to come and take him home,"" she says.The hospital has since put up a warning outside the lift asking people not to use it while it is being repaired.']"

If this conflict escalates to all-out war, it could dwarf the destruction in Gaza, draw in Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, spread embers around the Middle East and embroil the US. Iran itself could intervene directly.The United Nations has warned of a “catastrophe beyond imagination”.For now, a low-level war simmers in the summer heat, along a 120km (75 mile) stretch of border. One spark here could set the Middle East alight.', 'Over the lapping of the waves, and the thwack thwack of paddle games on the beach, a sound cuts through - a sudden deep boom.Soon smoke billows from a hillside in the distance after an Israeli strike.Around the pool in a resort hotel, a few sunbathers stand briefly to scan the horizon.Others don’t move a tanned limb.Explosions are part of the sound of summer 2024 in the ancient Lebanese city of Tyre, as Hezbollah and Israel exchange fire across the border 25 kilometres (15 miles) away.“Another day, another bomb,” says Roland, 49, with a shrug, as he relaxes on a lilo. He lives abroad but is back home on holiday.“We got used to it somehow over the months,” says his friend Mustafa, 39, “though children are still a little bit scared.” He nods towards his daughter Miral, 7, who is dripping wet from the pool.“When she hears an explosion, she always asks, ‘will there be a bomb now?’” he says.', 'Earlier this month, there was a massive blast in his neighbourhood in Tyre, as his family of four were having a meal. Israel had assassinated a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Nimah Nasser.“We heard the noise,” Mustafa says, “and we carried on eating.”But the sunbathers on the beach in Tyre may be on borrowed time. This city will be in the firing line in the event of all-out war, along with the rest of southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah stronghold.We are now at the water’s edge of a potentially devastating war which both sides say they don’t want. Iran doesn’t seem to want it either.How did we get here?', 'On October 8th last year – one day after Hamas gunmen stormed out of Gaza and killed about 1,200 Israelis as well as taking 251 others hostage – Hezbollah joined in, firing at Israeli targets from Lebanon.The Shia Islamist armed group said it was acting in support of Gaza.Soon Israel was firing back.Hezbollah, which is also a political party, is the most powerful force in Lebanon.Like Hamas, it is classed as a terrorist organisation by many countries, including the UK and the US.But unlike Hamas, Hezbollah has the firepower to seriously threaten Israel.It is believed to have an arsenal of more than 150,000 rockets and missiles - some precision-guided - capable of inflicting heavy damage around the country.What is Hezbollah in Lebanon and will it go to war with Israel?Put simply Hezbollah - its English translation, the Party of God - has more arms than many countries.Its backer Iran – which denies Israel’s right to exist – is happy to train and fund the enemies of the Jewish state.The conflict has been heating up, with thousands of cross-border strikes.Some countries have already told their nationals to leave Lebanon urgently, including Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and Saudi Arabia. The UK has advised against all travel to the country and is urging Britons who are here to leave - while they still can.So far, both sides are mainly striking military targets, close to the border -  staying within familiar red lines.', 'But here on the Lebanese side, we have seen destruction in civilian areas with scorched fields, flattened houses and abandoned villages.And the current tit-for-tat has already driven tens of thousands from their homes - more than 90,000 in Lebanon and about 60,000 in Israel.Israeli officials say 33 people have been killed so far in Hezbollah attacks, mostly soldiers.Lebanon’s losses are far higher at 466, according to the Ministry of Health here. Most of the dead were fighters.Sally Skaiki was not.', '“I never called her Sally,” says her father Hussein Abdul Hassan Skaiki. “I always called her ‘my life’ - she was everything for me.”“She was the only girl in the house, and we spoiled her, me and her three brothers.”Sally, 25, was a volunteer paramedic. She was killed by an Israeli strike after sunset on 14 June as she stood in the doorway of her building.Her father wears the black of mourning, and the green scarf of the Shia Amal movement, which is allied to Hezbollah.', 'We meet in his village of Deir Qanoun En-Naher, 30km (18 miles) from the border. The main road is dotted with sun-bleached posters of fighters killed in battle against Israel - some in recent months, others back in 2006 when the two sides last went to war.In that conflict, Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill but at huge cost to Lebanon and its people. There was massive destruction, and more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians were killed - according to official figures - along with an unconfirmed number of Hezbollah fighters.Israel’s death toll was 160, according to the government, most of them soldiers.By Hussein’s side there is a large poster of Sally, in her headscarf and paramedic uniform. He speaks of his daughter with pride and with anguish.“She loved to help people,” he says. “Any problem that happened, she rushed there. She was well-loved in the village. She always had a smile on her face.”As we speak there is a loud boom which rattles the windows.Hussein says it is a normal, daily occurrence.“Since a long time, Israel killed our people here,” he says.“We can’t forgive them. There is no hope of peace with them.”This time, there is no death or destruction. Instead, Israeli warplanes are breaking the sound barrier to spread fear.And, since October, Israel has been spreading something else in southern Lebanon - choking, searing clumps of white phosphorus, contained in munitions.', 'The chemical substance ignites immediately on contact with oxygen. It sticks to skin and clothing and can burn through bone, according to the World Health Organization.Moussa al-Moussa - a farmer stooped by his 77 years - knows only too well.He says Israel fired white phosphorous shells at his land in the village of al-Bustan every day for over a month, robbing him of breath, and his livelihood.“I had my scarf on, and I wrapped it around my mouth and nose until I was brought to the hospital,” he tells me, gesturing to the red and white keffiyeh – the traditional Arab scarf - on his head.“We didn’t have any masks.  I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t see a metre in front of me. And if you touch a fragment a week later it will ignite and burn again.”The international campaign group, Human Rights Watch, has verified the use of white phosphorus over several populated areas in southern Lebanon, including al-Bustan.It says Israel’s use of white phosphorus is “unlawfully indiscriminate in populated areas”.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) dispute this, saying the use of white phosphorus shells to create a smokescreen “is lawful under international law”.  It says these shells are not used in densely populated areas “with certain exceptions”.', 'Like many farmers along the border, Moussa fears Israel has poisoned his tobacco crop and his olive groves.“White phosphorous burns the ground, it burns people and the crops and buildings,” he says.Even if he can return home, he is afraid to bring in a harvest in case it harms his family or his buyers.He lives in limbo - in classroom 4B of a vocational school in Tyre. About 30 families who fled the border area are sheltering in the building. Washing is strung across the school yard. A lone little boy races up and down the empty corridors on a bicycle.When I ask Moussa how many wars he has seen, he begins to laugh.“We spent our lives in wars,” he says. “Only God knows if another one is coming.”', 'As one of Hezbollah’s most senior commanders, Mohammed Nimah Nasser, was a wanted man. He fought Israel in 2006, and before, and went on to fight in Syria and Iraq. In recent months he “planned, led and supervised many military operations against the Israeli enemy”, according to Hezbollah.Israel tracked him down in Tyre on 3 July. Death came from the sky in broad daylight, with an air strike which turned his car into a fireball.In the Hezbollah stronghold of south Beirut, he was given a hero’s funeral, or rather a “martyr’s” one.The event was carefully choreographed and strictly segregated - men in one area, women in another - including the press.His coffin, draped in the yellow flag of Hezbollah, was carried by pall bearers in camouflage uniforms and red berets. Many more fighters stood to attention, lines deep. There was a brass band in spotless white uniforms, if not in perfect harmony.It had the feel of a state funeral - in a country that lacks a functioning state.Lebanon has no president, a caretaker government and a shattered economy. It is carved up by sect, and hollowed out by corruption, its citizens left to fend for themselves. Many Lebanese are weary. The last thing they want is another war.But as the funeral prayers concluded, the talk among mourners was of “martyrdom” not death, and of readiness for war, if it comes.', 'Hassan Hamieh, a 35-year-old nurse, told us he would fight. “We are not afraid,” he said.“In fact, we are longing for an all-out war. Martyrdom is the shortest path to God. Young or old, we will all take part in this war, if it is forced upon us.”Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has stressed the armed group is ready, but not eager, for war. He says if there is a ceasefire agreed in Gaza, Hezbollah will cease fire too, immediately.Will that satisfy Israel? Maybe not.It sees Hezbollah as a permanent threat too close for comfort. At the very least, it wants its heavily armed enemy to pull back from the border.There have been plenty of bellicose threats. Israel’s Education Minister, Yoav Kish, said Lebanon would be “annihilated”. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant chimed in, saying the country would be returned “to the stone age”.As the attacks and counter attacks continue, families are destroyed. This month parents have been ripped from children, and children from parents.An Israeli couple were killed in their car by Hezbollah rockets as they headed for home in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria. They left behind three teenage children. And in southern Lebanon three children were killed in an Israeli strike earlier this week. They were aged between four and eight, and their parents were Syrian farm workers.The IDF approved “operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon” a month ago.For now, no tanks are rolling over the border. There has been no political decision to attack. Israel is still waging war in Gaza and fighting on two fronts could overstretch the military.But without a diplomatic solution between Israel and Hezbollah - two old enemies - all-out war may be coming, if not now, then later.Additional reporting by Goktay Koraltan and Ghassan Ibraheem']"

""People cut corners and when you try to raise alarm, some feel that you are trying to victimise or oppress them. They use their people in positions of authority to circumvent the rules.""', 'Following the building collapse at Saints Academy, the local governor has ordered a structural audit of all schools and public buildings in Plateau state, of which Jos is the capital. Officials in his government say it is not clear whether the school’s owner, who has since died, ever had a construction permit for the site.The BBC was unable to get comment from the school\'s management.Some also suspect that mining activity close by could have damaged the school building, so the governor has also ordered the arrest of any artisanal miners found digging in residential areas in the state.But officials suspect that the main problem was with how the school was built.""Even as a layman who is not a building professional, you can see that the materials used in the construction are not standard. But we will investigate the cause of the collapse and punish those found culpable,"" Musa Ashom, the state Commissioner for Information, tells the BBC.Similar promises came from Nigeria\'s Housing Minister, Ahmed Dangiwa, who spoke scathingly of ""unscrupulous"" individuals whose actions he said had resulted in the Jos school collapse and caused unquantifiable loss.But those words will come as little consolation to the many bereft families, like that of Chinecherem Joy Emeka.The 13-year-old was one of the best dancers at her school and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day, says her mother Blessing Nwabuchi.Chinecherem, or Chi Chi as loved ones called her, was sitting her end-of-year exams the day she died.Photos like this one, from her junior high graduation last year, are precious reminders of what she achieved - and everything she might have gone on to become.', ""Should I stay or should I go?

Kenya's ‘serial killer’ mystery - five key questions,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19k0zj1dw3o#3,"Still reeling from the discovery of bodies in a quarry, Kenyans are trying to find out more.","Tue, 16 Jul 2024 23:58:35 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.589695,"['The arrest of an alleged serial killer in Kenya has shocked the country - but many have serious questions about the circumstances of his arrest.Police say Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, confessed to killing 42 women - though his lawyer told a court on Tuesday he was tortured into a confession.It is the latest twist in a perplexing story that followed the recent discovery of the dismembered remains of nine bodies wrapped in plastic at a disused quarry, which is used as rubbish tip and is close to a police post in the capital, Nairobi.', ""Many people are finding it hard to understand that the police were unable to detect that bodies were being left around 100m (109 yards) from one of their offices in the informal settlement of Mukuru Kwa Njenga.Residents have criticised officers for their “laxity and unprofessionalism” in dealing with the crime.In response, acting police chief Douglas Kanja announced on Sunday that the officers from Kware police post near the scene had been transferred.It is not clear whether they have been questioned over how the deaths went unnoticed.But given the force's poor human rights record, the police watchdog said it was undertaking a preliminary investigation to establish whether there was any police connection."", 'What is even more baffling is how a member of the public came to discover them.The family of Josephine Owino, who had gone missing, says she came to one of them ""in a dream"" and helped point them in the right direction.Diana Keya, Ms Owino’s cousin, told Citizen TV that the family then paid some young men near the rubbish tip to comb through the debris.That was how nine severely mutilated bodies were found on Friday. They were wrapped in nylon bags, which were tied with rope.The first statement by police said the “alarm was raised” by the public.When questioned later the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations Mohamed Amin said: “We are not dreamers and we do not believe in dreams.”', ""Police said the bodies recovered were in different stages of decomposition, suggesting that the victims had been killed at different times.In the now-disputed confession, the police say Mr Khalusha allegedly admitted to murdering the women over a period of two years.What is not clear, though, is whether the remains had been dumped over that time or more recently.Hussein Khalid, the executive director of rights group Haki Africa, told the BBC that the police's version of events had “a lot of loopholes”."", 'After not apparently suspecting anything for two years the police then made an arrest in less than three days after the discovery of the bodies.On Monday, police said Mr Khalusha was detained at a bar in the small hours of that morning while watching the Euro final football match.They displayed to the media some of the items said to have been recovered from the suspect’s house - also close to where the bodies were found - including 10 phones, a laptop, identity cards and personal female clothing.The police said they had traced Mr Khalusha’s whereabouts after geo-locating the mobile phone of one of his alleged victims.Mr Khalusha’s lawyer has questioned the validity of the evidence.', 'Only one body has been identified so far - that of 24-year-old Roseline Ongogo.Her brother Emmanuel Ongogo told the BBC she went missing on 28 June after she left the house to look for casual work.He said the family went to the morgue when they heard bodies had been recovered from Mukuru.They identified her as she in the same clothes she had disappeared wearing and had the same hairstyle.', ""The police also allege that Mr Khalusha's wife was his first victim and say her identity card was found among the belongings of other alleged victims.The family of Ms Owino, who said they dreamt about her whereabouts, told the BBC they were still waiting for an identification."", ""The discovery has brought back memories of the brutal murder of 20-year-old Rita Waeni in January.Her dismembered body was found at a short-term rental apartment in Nairobi. The case is yet to be solved.The death triggered nationwide demonstrations against the rising cases of femicide and other violence against women.Amnesty International said more than 500 cases of femicide were recorded in Kenya between 2016 and 2023.All the bodies recovered from the rubbish tip are female. A handful of elected women leaders who converged at morgue asked the government to speed up the investigations and put an end to such violence.When asked what the police were doing to address cases of femicide and violence against women, spokesperson Resila Onyango said she could not address that issue specifically - but she told the BBC that the work of the police was “to protect life and property of everyone”.This scrutiny of the police comes as more Kenyan officers arrive in Haiti, where they are leading an international mission to tackle the country's powerful gangs. Lobby groups in Port-au-Prince have previously questioned the credibility of the officers over claims of brutality and extra-judicial killings, which Kenya's government has always denied."", 'Kenya protesters traumatised by abductions - lawyer‘We are the Church’: Kenyan tax protesters take on Christian leadersKenyan cult leader charged with 191 murders', 'Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica']"

New tech aims to keep polar bears and people apart,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cljy48yj99wo#3,Fears about the two species coming into contact are growing as Arctic sea ice melts.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 23:40:43 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.590318,"[""At the end of the Canadian Arctic summer, polar bears head inland to wait for the ice to form.   And while thousands of tourists  flock to catch a glimpse of these magnificent predators, researchers are developing novel ways to keep people and bears safely separated.  New tracking devices that stick in polar bears’ fur could be the key to protecting both people and bears - by closely monitoring the animals' locations.Polar bears now spend more of the year on land, as Arctic sea ice melts, so conservationists are increasingly concerned about bears and people coming into contact.The tracking tags, which have been tested on bears in Canadian Arctic, could help prevent those encounters, by “keeping a remote eye” on the bears."", 'Lead researcher Tyler Ross, a PhD candidate from York University in Toronto, said the fur tags were “particularly promising” for the prevention of these “human-bear interactions”.In communities in the southern Canadian Arctic, where the scientists tested these tags, polar bears that wander too close to a community are sometimes caught, transported and released in carefully selected sites away from towns and villages. “These tags could be fitted to those bears to monitor where they are after they\'ve been released,” explained Mr Ross.“If they\'re coming back towards the community, conservation staff would have a sense of where they are, and they could head them off. I think that\'s where they offer considerable promise.""The researcher, who studies polar bear ecology, also says the tags could fill important gaps in knowledge about the bears. And as the Arctic climate warms up rapidly, the need to monitor bears becomes increasingly urgent.', ""“There's a dearth of information about male polar bear movements, because they can't be equipped with conventional tracking collars,” said Mr Ross.The sea ice [that the polar bears use as a platform from which to hunt] is disappearing faster than it has in the past,” explained Mr Ross. “So the winter hunting season is getting shorter. We want to know where they're moving in response.”Polar bears are difficult to tag. Male bears’ heads are smaller than their necks, so tracking collars can just slip off.Another option is ear tags - attached by piercing the bear’s ear. They require an animal to be recaptured in order to remove the tag and, in rare cases, can injure the ear.The three new tags the researchers tested were designed by the company 3M in collaboration with the charity Polar Bears International. They all attach to the bears’ coarse fur.To fit the tags, scientists had to locate and sedate bears. They then assessed the quality of the data they received from each device and noted when the tags fell off."", 'The best performing device was called a SeaTrkr tag, which is “crimped” into the bears’ fur. It stayed attached for an average of 58 days and  - with an in-built GPS system - allowed the scientists to pinpoint the bears’ location to within just a few metres.“It’s ideal to have something that falls off naturally - that’s not permanently  attached to the bear,” explained Mr Ross. “But anything that lasts in the order of a few months would be great [for our research], because then you’re getting these important seasons that the bears are going through throughout the year.”Climate change is bringing bears and humans into closer proximity, making places where polar bears and people coexist, riskier for both.One  US Geological Survey study in 2022 that that used data from satellite tracking collars on more than 400 polar bears in Alaska, shows the time they spend onshore has grown significantly in recent decades.“Getting a better sense of polar bears’ movements is really crucial,” Mr Ross commented. “Particularly given the state of their environment at this point.”This study of the bear tags is published in the journal Animal Biotelemetry.

Votes for 16-year-olds fails to make King's Speech,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd09l31rrjo#0,Commons leader Lucy Powell says the measure remains a Labour commitment for the current parliament. ,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 13:38:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.882855,"['Labour\'s manifesto pledge to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 in UK general elections has not been included in the King\'s Speech. But Commons leader Lucy Powell told the BBC votes for 16 and 17-year-olds remained a commitment, and she hoped they would be able to vote in the next general election.Forcing members of the House of Lords to retire at the age of 80 was another pledge which did not make the cut when King Charles read out the new government\'s planned laws for the new parliamentary session. During the recent election campaign, the Conservatives accused Labour of trying to ""distort the political system"" to entrench itself in power.   ', 'Then-Home Secretary James Cleverly warned that measures like extending the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds were an attempt by Labour to ""lock in their power permanently, because they don\'t really feel confident they\'re going to be able to make a credible case to the British people at the next election"".Pressed on Radio 5 Live on why lowering the voting age had not featured in this  King\'s Speech, Ms Powell said there were ""plenty of big bills that didn’t make it into this"".  An elections bill would come later in the parliamentary cycle, she promised, adding:  ""It\'s absolutely a manifesto commitment."" Asked if 16 and 17-year-olds would be able to vote in the next general election, she said: ""I hope so. That\'s the intention.""

That was intended to be only a short-term compromise, but the arrangements have persisted for 25 years. The King indicated that further constitutional changes were likely later in the parliamentary cycle.The government would ""strengthen the integrity of elections and encourage wide participation in the democratic process"", he said.  Alex Norris, a minister in the housing, communities and local government department, posted on X: ""Too many people feel their voice is not being heard in our democracy, with millions of legitimate voters still not registered to vote.""This Government will restore faith in politics. From introducing votes at 16 to handing power back to communities with our English Devolution Bill, we will give those who contribute to our country a say in how it is governed."" The UK voting age was last lowered in 1969 - from 21 to 18 - by Harold Wilson\'s Labour government. The age was reduced to 16 for elections in Scotland - by the Scottish Parliament - in 2015.

Falling clothes prices help keep inflation rate steady,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck7gzllwlmlo#0,"The cost of living rose at 2% in the year to June, in line with the Bank of England's target.","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 08:57:09 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.883108,"['UK inflation held steady in June, remaining at the Bank of England\'s target rate of 2%, according to the latest official figures.Discounts on clothes in summer sales helped offset the soaring cost of hotel stays.Overall, inflation rose at 2% in the year to June, unchanged from May.It means that the cost of living is still rising but at a rate that the central bank is comfortable with, after nearly three years of above-target inflation which has squeezed household finances.The latest figures showed clothing and footwear costs fell last month, while food and drink inflation has dropped sharply from the highs of recent years.Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), told the BBC\'s Today programme that there was a ""higher level of discounting"".The figures also showed that second-hand car costs fell but by less than the same time last year.Prices in restaurants and hotels rose more than a year ago though, putting some upward pressure on the headline inflation rate. ', 'Hotel prices jumped by 8.8% compared with the previous month, the ONS said, whereas prices in restaurants and cafes went up by 0.3% on a monthly basis.The figures also showed the costs of package holidays, cinemas, theatres and concerts were rising.', 'However, in areas like services, which include everything from restaurants to hairdressers, price increases remain persistent.That could raise questions for Bank of England policymakers over when they should begin to cut interest rates.Darren Jones, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, said that families\' budgets across Britain were still being squeezed.""We face the legacy of 14 years of chaos and economic irresponsibility. That is why this government is taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off.""The Bank\'s base rate - which is used to help set mortgage rates and other borrowing costs - currently stands at a 16-year-high of 5.25% after it was increased in a bid to tackle soaring inflation.Its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which votes to set the rate, has held interest rates at this level for several months but some economists have predicted they will cut the rate at the next vote on 1 August.Leanne Morgan and her husband Gareth bought their house in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2016 when interest rates were much lower. Their five-year fixed mortgage deal came to an end this month and their new rate stands at just over 4% - pushing their mortgage payments up by £5,200 a year. ', 'Mrs Morgan said the higher mortgage payments had restricted the things they were able to do with their three older children.""We can\'t have family holidays, we\'ve not been able to do so much with the children... it affects where I shop for food, I’m always looking for discounts. We sit together, we look at what our costs are, where we can cut back and look at a budget.""She said she was optimistic, however, that the UK economy was over the worst and that better times were ahead.""I think sometimes the doom and gloom that we talk about can actually make us feel very negative,"" she said.""But if we have a good conversation about what is possible, and working with what we\'ve got, we can have a better conversation about it.""The overall inflation rate has fallen sharply since October 2022, when it peaked at 11.1%. But some of the underlying measures of inflation being watched closely by the Bank of England remain stubbornly high. Inflation in the services sector, for example, remained at 5.7% in June, while core inflation, which strips out the effects of more volatile items like energy prices, held at 3.5%. ', 'Alongside some other stronger figures for the economy in recent days, it may give some pause for thought for members of the Bank of England committee deciding interest rates next month. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund listed the UK among countries who might need to keep interest rates ""higher for even longer"" than originally anticipated to squeeze inflation out of the system.Markets have been anticipating that rate cuts will start on 1 August, helping fixed mortgage rates fall. The latest numbers suggest it will be a finely balanced decision.On Wednesday investors pared back bets on a rate cut taking place, saying there was about a 35% chance - down from just under 50% before the data was published.Separately, fresh official figures on the housing market helped give an insight into the costs facing both buyers and renters.They show the rate at which UK rents are rising is close to a record high, hitting 8.6% in the 12 months to June. The pace of the increase slowed very slightly on the previous month but remains well above the norm of the last 15 years or so.House prices also rose by 2.2% in the year to May, the ONS said, with the average price of a home in England now above £300,000.']"

Amazon workers narrowly reject union in historic vote,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vd72zrpr1o#1,If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. ,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:05:05 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.883800,"['The GMB has narrowly lost its historic bid for union recognition at the Amazon warehouse in Coventry. Some 49.5% of workers balloted voted in favour, while 50.5% voted against. The union needed a majority to vote in favour.If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. The online giant would have been forced to negotiate with workers on issues such as pay and conditions.In a statement, Amazon said it placed ""enormous value on engaging directly"" with staff.""We look forward to continuing on that path with our team in Coventry,"" it added.The GMB told the BBC it is considering trying again to get recognition at the Coventry site and that discussions are taking place about its strategy. The process would include persuading the Central Arbitration Committee, which is in charge of overseeing applications for recognition, that the pool of workers eligible to vote had changed.', 'The GMB, which lost by 28 votes, said its drive for recognition fell “agonisingly short” and accused Amazon of “union-busting”.It said there were “anti-union messages by company bosses, including multiple anti-union seminars” at the warehouse.It added that “the fire lit by workers in Coventry and across the UK is still burning”, and that the union would “carry on the fight”  for low paid workers.', ""The union's fight for recognition had been described as a David vs Goliath battle, with workers facing fierce resistance from the online giant.It began with a rag tag show of defiance in the summer of 2022, after Amazon offered workers a pay rise of between 35p and 50p an hour. Having toiled in warehouses during the Covid pandemic, workers said this felt like an insult, and in Coventry a small group of angry workers spontaneously walked out and protested outside the fulfilment centre. Then the GMB got involved and urged the workforce to unionise.In January 2023, with a GMB membership of just 50, Coventry workers held the first ever Amazon strike in the UK. "", 'It went on to organise a further 37 days of industrial action over the last year and by recruiting on the picket line, steadily built up its membership to more than 1,400 members out of the centre\'s estimated 3,000 plus workers.In April the union launched a legal challenge against Amazon, claiming it used underhand tactics to encourage members to cancel their union membership.On Wednesday it said that legal challenge would continue. As part of the challenge, the GMB says Amazon put up posters in fulfilment centres featuring QR codes that generated an email to the union’s membership department requesting that their membership be cancelled.Amazon responded saying that “employees were telling us they wanted to cancel their membership but could not find a way to do so, so we provided information to help. ""We have always been clear, that union membership is an employee’s personal choice.”', 'Amazon, which is one of the UK\'s largest private sector employers, with 75,000 workers, made it clear all along that it did not want to recognise a union and that it wanted to retain direct communication with its staff. After the vote on Wednesday, it further reiterated that “having daily conversations” with staff was “an essential part of our work culture”.“We value that direct relationship and so do our employees. This is why we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, act on their feedback, and invest heavily in great pay, benefits and skills development,"" the firm added.The GMB says it is surprised by what it sees as the fearlessness of an overwhelmingly immigrant workforce, many of whom arrived recently from South Asia. Union organisers estimate that as little as 5% of the Coventry employees are British born and its campaign leaflets were translated into 12 different languages. They say that in the beginning many were frightened to get involved but as the strikes wore on, and people saw that workers who’d joined picket lines weren’t facing disciplinary action, their confidence grew.The union is hopeful that the government will strengthen their power to organise. Labour has promised legislation in today\'s King\'s Speech to make it easier for unions to win recognition ballots by lowering the required threshold for victory and to make it easier for union officials to recruit in workplaces.', 'The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said that despite taking on one of the ""world\'s largest corporate giants"", the Coventry union members ""only narrowly missed out"" on securing recognition.""With Labour set to usher in a new era of stronger workers’ rights, companies like Amazon are on the wrong side of history,"" he added.But Gregor Gall, a professor of industrial relations at Glasgow university, questioned whether GMB had the resources to take the fight to other Amazon centres.""The cost of union organising is very high. The GMB had officers working full time on it. We won\'t necessarily see organising drives elsewhere,"" he said.Professor Gall\'s caution is understandable considering what has happened in the United States. In 2022 Amazon workers at its Staten Island warehouse in New York became the first in the US to win union recognition. Two years on, the company has still not sat down to negotiate with the union and continues to fight legal challenges to the vote.']"

The BBC understands he took his own life.A fatal accident inquiry - which is mandatory for any death in custody - will be held to examine the circumstances.A prison service spokesperson said: “Every death, whether in prison custody or in our communities, is a tragedy for all those who knew and supported the individual.“Following the death of someone in our care, Police Scotland are advised, and the matter reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Fatal accident inquiries are held in due course.”The 17-year-old was sent to Polmont after pleading guilty to a charge of acting in a disorderly manner and being in possession of weapons with intent to ""assault and murder"" a 16-year-old girl.He had put an airgun, shovel, wrench, duct tape and rope in the boot of a car as he went looking for the girl in Moray in March last year.While the case was ongoing, he stayed in a secure children’s unit before being moved to Polmont.Police Scotland said officers had been made aware of the death of a 17-year-old at Polmont and it was not thought to be suspicious.', 'The Scottish government said in March 2022 that 16 and 17-year-olds would no longer be placed in young offenders institutions.It said it wanted to end the placement of under-18s in custody ""without delay"", and pledged to fund ""care-based alternatives"" and shift the approach from ""one of punishment to one of love and support"".The announcement came after Scotland\'s chief inspector of prisons, Wendy Sinclair-Gieben, said sending 16 and 17-year-olds to Polmont - especially those who had not yet been convicted - was a breach of their human rights.The Children (Care and Justice) (Scotland) Bill - which sets out that children under the age of 18 will no longer be sent to prison - received Royal Assent last month and became an act of parliament.Separate legislation passed by Holyrood to incorporate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) came into force on Tuesday.As of 12 July, there were nine 16 to 17-year-olds held in custody at Polmont. Six were untried, two had been sentenced and one had been awaiting sentencing.', 'Wendy Sinclair-Gieben told BBC Scotland News, the “intent” to remove children from prisons in Scotland was there, but the speed at which it was being achieved was “not great”.She told BBC News: ""There should be no more children in prison. I don’t think Polmont is a good place for children.”Minister for Victims and Community Safety Siobhian Brown, said every death in custody was a tragedy and that the government was working to end the placement of under-18s in young offenders institutions.She said: ""We are working with the Scottish Prison Service and secure accommodation providers to commence these provisions shortly. The decision on whether to detain a child remains with the independent judiciary.”', ""A joint fatal accident inquiry (FAI) was held earlier this year into the deaths of Katie Allan, 21, and William Brown, 16, who both took their own lives at Polmont within months of each other in 2018. Katie, a geography student at Glasgow University, was jailed for16 months for drink-driving after hitting a 15-year-old boy, who was knocked unconscious.William, also known as William Lindsay, who had never been convicted of a crime, had only been sent to Polmont because a place could not be found for him in a secure children's unit.A separate FAI was also recently held into the death of Jack McKenzie, who took his own life at Polmont on 3 September 2021.He had been on remand at Polmont for rape and sexual assault charges - which he denied - since January of that year."", 'Katie Allan’s mother, Linda Allan told BBC Scotland she is “devastated” for Jonathan Beadle\'s family but she is not surprised to hear about the latest death in Polmont.""The only thing that surprises me is that not more young people are dying,"" she said.Ms Allan has previously criticised the ""inadequacies of the prison suicide strategy, which apparently ignores evidence"" and ""the flawed system of relying on prisoners self-reporting suicide ideation"".Sheriff Simon Collins, who heard both inquiries, is expected to make recommendations for change when he delivers his determination into the circumstances of all three deaths later in the year.The purpose of an FAI is to establish whether the deaths could have been prevented.It will also examine what precautions could be taken in future to try and stop young people from taking their own lives in prison.']"

Opposition parties have called for the first minister to fill the roles vacated.Meanwhile Wales\' previous first minister Mark Drakeford has said that Mr Gething was ""haunted"" by decisions he took which he has never been able to shake off.Mark Drakeford said the outgoing Welsh Labour leader was ""dogged"" by decisions taken over campaign donations and the sacking of a minister.Another former holder of Wales\' top job, Alun Michael, said Mr Gething had been ""forced out"".', 'Mr Miles came second in the leadership contest in March with 48.3% of the vote, versus Mr Gething\'s 51.7%.Since the result he moved from the job of education minister to economy secretary under the new first minister.He had declined to give a view on the £200,000 donation from a controversial waste company, whose owner had been previously convicted of environmental offences, during the campaign itself - but a month later said he would not have accepted the money.On Monday, a day before his resignation, he repeatedly failed to support Mr Gething in an interview.In his letter to the first minister outlining why he was quitting, Mr Miles said: ""The events of the last few months including you loss of the confidence vote in the Senedd have been incredibly painful.""This has become a distraction from the important work of the Welsh government and is damaging our party"".Dates for the contest are yet to be set, although Mr Gething has said his replacement would be installed by the autumn.', 'But two supporters of the first minister have told BBC Wales that Mr Miles\' involvement in forcing Mr Gething\'s exit makes him unsuitable to take over.One Gething supporter suggested they would rather ""die in a ditch"" than have Mr Miles as leader of the party.They said they would like to see Eluned Morgan run, saying she was a communicator who could connect the party with traditional backers of Labour.Another supporter said Mr Miles could not unite the party and there was ""a very strong feeling that the person who is associated with a bloodied knife cannot claim the crown"".They added: ""I\'m really worried about what this says to the world, to people in the United Kingdom and especially in Wales who are not white.""It looks like a bunch of people have drawn daggers and knifed Vaughan without giving him a chance. I do find that really difficult to deal with.""In a response, a backer of Mr Miles said: “The people who did their best to block Jeremy last time are up to their old tricks, it seems. Let the members decide.""Mr Miles had more nominations from Labour Senedd members than Mr Gething last year, with 16 versus Mr Gething\'s ten.', 'A separate Miles supporter said it was not ""credible"" for Mr Gething to carry on through the summer as he no longer had the support of ""the group, cabinet or Senedd"".

BBC News went to Rothwell to find out what residents think about the statistic.', 'An industrial estate at one end, and at the other, a quaint 19th Century Anglican church and pub. In the mile and a bit between these local landmarks are more than 300 homes.Wood Lane, in the south Leeds suburb of Rothwell, is like many other UK streets of its kind, with bus stops, a bakery, shops, a hairdresser and other day-to-day amenities. But burglaries on this street and the surrounding area have gone unsolved.', 'Research for Channel 4\'s Dispatches suggests that 56 break-ins had occurred in an area known as Rothwell Outer, none of which had resulted in a conviction.   West Yorkshire Police says its burglary detection rates are in-line with other parts of the country, but that some offences were unsolved because of a lack of evidence.It says the figures quoted in the programme were solely for 2021 and involved break-ins to some homes but were mostly non-dwelling burglaries from places such as sheds and garages.One victim of burglary is Amanda, who has lived around here for 15 years. Her home was raided last winter, with thieves stealing cash and jewellery. She says the police were ""great"" in their initial rapid response to the incident, though she has been left in the dark since. ""They did everything they could do in the first instance,"" Amanda explains. ""They came out straight away and you had investigators come out to assess the scene within a matter of hours. ""In terms of anything since, we just presume nothing has happened because we have not heard anything. ""Then again, I don\'t really know what to expect because this has never happened to us before.""You just have to trust the police are doing what they can, and if they find the evidence they can link it to someone.""', 'Amanda suggests the geography of Wood Lane and surrounding streets, which feature an array of snickets, alleyways and side roads, may make the area potentially more attractive to burglars needing a quick getaway. Amanda says the incident did initially make her feel ""less safe"" but that she and her family have done what they can to make their home as secure as possible. She also says a local PCSO has knocked on the door in the months since, which she finds reassuring. But others are less complimentary about the police presence around here, even though the office of Rothwell\'s neighbourhood policing team sits nearby', 'Steve Sutton, who has lived on Wood Lane for 18 years, has not been a victim of burglary, but knows residents who have. ""It doesn\'t surprise me they haven\'t been solved,"" he says. ""The police presence is zero. You see them driving up and down very occasionally.""Steve says the burglaries make you ""a bit more conscious"" about what is going on, especially as he says some of the thefts have taken place during the day.But, he adds: ""Generally, in terms of other crime it\'s a decent area, to be fair.""', 'Long-serving Liberal Democrat councillor for the area Stewart Golton says there is ""frustration"" in the community, ""because there aren\'t enough police to respond to the issues that we\'ve got"". ""Those statistics about burglaries are not a surprise, because we encourage people to report crime and then it feels like the crime you do report doesn\'t get responded to,"" Mr Golton says. ""We appreciate it is hard to catch criminals once they have committed the crime but it would be nice to know there is least an attempt at doing so, because otherwise what is the deterrent for future criminals to not do it?""On the high street in Rothwell, about five miles south east of Leeds city centre, shoppers echo concerns about a lack of visible police presence and about anti-social behaviour. Quad bikes, a particular bugbear for many communities across West Yorkshire in recent years, are raised frequently as an issue. ', 'John Graham, who was himself a victim of an unsolved burglary more than a decade ago, says: ""They are going round in gangs and a lot of them are wearing balaclavas and masks now.""I have lived around here for 40 years and it has changed a lot - for the worse.""', 'Daniel Newton, 34, lives just a stone\'s throw from Rothwell town centre and says some of the quad bike issues are caused by young people riding in from nearby Middleton.But, he suggests, there is a vicious circle of some young offenders committing anti-social behaviour because society ignores them. ""I have found if you try to connect and engage with them, they engage with you in a reasonable way,"" he says.""But they become rebellious because no-one is really engaging with them and they feel like outsiders. ""So it becomes reciprocal.""', 'Chatting outside Morrisons on the main street are friends Mary Kiernan and Pat Firth. Ms Firth lives in nearby Lofthouse, but comes into Rothwell to shop. ""I haven\'t lived in Rothwell for 18 years, but when we did there was always a PCSO walking down here,"" she recalls.""When we lived here it was a lot different to what it is now. ""I can understand why people get edgy when there\'s young groups going around on quad bikes.""', 'West Yorkshire Police says it recognises ""the huge impact"" burglaries have on victims and has made ""significant investments"" to reduce burglaries, which have declined since 2019 in West Yorkshire. It adds: ""We are also committed to attending all home burglaries in line with recently published national guidance.""Some burglaries are finalised as unsolved because of a lack of evidence or because a suspect cannot be identified.""Our detection rates are relatively in-line with other police forces in England and Wales, but we continually work to improve the quality of burglary investigations by listening to feedback from victims, looking at new and improved ways of working and training, and upskilling our officers and staff.""Addressing the wider issues around neighbourhood policing, the force says: ""While Rothwell has some officers who work specifically within its community to provide a familiar presence for people, it does not have a set number of allocated officers and is part of a larger Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT), which covers the Leeds South area.""Police officers and staff who work within NPTs are deployed to the areas where they are needed the most, so communities can be provided with reassurance when they need it.""Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

EastEnders spiking story ‘important’ to raise awareness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72v8rv3jp1o#3,Molly Rainford's character Anna Knight is the victim of spiking in a new five-part web series.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 01:06:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.887541,"['EastEnders actress Molly Rainford says it\'s ""important"" for the soap to tackle spiking in a new experimental storyline.Her character Anna Knight stars in a new five-part mini series uploaded by the show\'s makers to social media.Called Spiked, it shows what happens to Anna when her drink gets spiked during a night out.The online shorts are accessible via a QR code displayed during the episode shown on BBC One on Tuesday night.Viewers who scan the image with their phones are taken to the five episodes and links to resources about spiking. Spiking is when someone puts alcohol or drugs into another person’s drink or body without their knowledge or consent.According to police, the majority of cases happen in public places such as bars and nightclubs.Although spiking is already illegal, its due to become a specific criminal offence under changes announced in the King\'s Speech, where the government announces its plans for the year ahead.MPs believe this will make it easier for police to respond to reports.', 'Symptoms of spiking can include memory loss, hallucinations and disorientation.EastEnders hopes to show viewers of the miniseries the symptoms through Anna\'s eyes as her night takes a turn for the worse.""I think it\'s so important that we show those signs,"" says Molly.The actress tells BBC Newsbeat it was ""really important"" for her to do her research to portray the experience accurately and highlight the symptoms.Molly also urges people to look out for their friends on nights out.""Are they acting differently? Is something not quite right?"" she says.', 'Molly hopes the series will create more awareness around spiking, and reach younger audiences online.""What better platform than social media to reach the people that it\'s directly affecting?"" Molly says.She adds she is constantly thinking about her safety on nights out. ""You have to kind of live in that bit of fear that it could happen and it\'s a real shame.""I’m lucky enough that I haven’t been spiked, but it shouldn’t be luck, it should be standard.""The effects of spiking are something Abbi Taylor, from Manchester, knows about all too well.""It was just the worst thing I\'ve experienced,"" she says.', 'Abbi, who\'s originally from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, says she realised she\'d been spiked as she got home from a day event two months ago.She describes the feeling as ""sheer panic"".""I started to notice my vision going blurry,"" she says. ""I started shaking, I was sweating."" As the effects grew stronger, Abbi says, she started to lose the ability to move her body.""I couldn\'t talk. If I tried to stand up - I\'d just collapse,"" she says.""It almost felt like I was trapped in this body that didn\'t feel like it was mine.""After having her drink spiked, Abbi says she no longer wants to go on nights out.Like Molly, she urges others to be alert to the signs.""If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone,"" she says.Dawn Dines, CEO of charity Stamp Out Spiking, which consulted on the EastEnders mini series, says ""education is key to preventing these incidents"".She hopes featuring the issue on EastEnders will ""inspire conversations"" that help to protect people.', 'The Metropolitan Police, which covers London, says 1,383 allegations of spiking were submitted in 2023 – an average of 26 allegations per week. It says reports increased by 13% in the last six months of 2023 compared with the same period the previous year.In 2023, the force made 70 arrests for spiking offences.Met Police Det Ch Supt Angela Craggs urged those who suspect they\'ve been spiked to come forward.Around the country, Samantha Millar, of the National Police Chiefs’ Council says, police forces have been ""working proactively"" to improve feelings of safety on nights out.""This includes regular, targeted patrols of busy town centres,"" Samantha says, adding that police also visit universities to raise awareness of spiking symptoms.The Home Office has said the law is part of the new Labour government\'s ""mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade"".The spiking law will apply in England and Wales.

That is why this government is taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off.""The Bank\'s base rate - which is used to help set mortgage rates and other borrowing costs - currently stands at a 16-year-high of 5.25% after it was increased in a bid to tackle soaring inflation.Its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which votes to set the rate, has held interest rates at this level for several months but some economists have predicted they will cut the rate at the next vote on 1 August.Leanne Morgan and her husband Gareth bought their house in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2016 when interest rates were much lower. Their five-year fixed mortgage deal came to an end this month and their new rate stands at just over 4% - pushing their mortgage payments up by £5,200 a year. ', 'Mrs Morgan said the higher mortgage payments had restricted the things they were able to do with their three older children.""We can\'t have family holidays, we\'ve not been able to do so much with the children... it affects where I shop for food, I’m always looking for discounts. We sit together, we look at what our costs are, where we can cut back and look at a budget.""She said she was optimistic, however, that the UK economy was over the worst and that better times were ahead.""I think sometimes the doom and gloom that we talk about can actually make us feel very negative,"" she said.""But if we have a good conversation about what is possible, and working with what we\'ve got, we can have a better conversation about it.""The overall inflation rate has fallen sharply since October 2022, when it peaked at 11.1%. But some of the underlying measures of inflation being watched closely by the Bank of England remain stubbornly high. Inflation in the services sector, for example, remained at 5.7% in June, while core inflation, which strips out the effects of more volatile items like energy prices, held at 3.5%. ', 'Alongside some other stronger figures for the economy in recent days, it may give some pause for thought for members of the Bank of England committee deciding interest rates next month. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund listed the UK among countries who might need to keep interest rates ""higher for even longer"" than originally anticipated to squeeze inflation out of the system.Markets have been anticipating that rate cuts will start on 1 August, helping fixed mortgage rates fall. The latest numbers suggest it will be a finely balanced decision.On Wednesday investors pared back bets on a rate cut taking place, saying there was about a 35% chance - down from just under 50% before the data was published.Separately, fresh official figures on the housing market helped give an insight into the costs facing both buyers and renters.They show the rate at which UK rents are rising is close to a record high, hitting 8.6% in the 12 months to June. The pace of the increase slowed very slightly on the previous month but remains well above the norm of the last 15 years or so.House prices also rose by 2.2% in the year to May, the ONS said, with the average price of a home in England now above £300,000.']"
Amazon workers narrowly reject union in historic vote,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vd72zrpr1o#0,If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. ,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:05:05 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.260383,"['The GMB has narrowly lost its historic bid for union recognition at the Amazon warehouse in Coventry. Some 49.5% of workers balloted voted in favour, while 50.5% voted against. The union needed a majority to vote in favour.If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. The online giant would have been forced to negotiate with workers on issues such as pay and conditions.In a statement, Amazon said it placed ""enormous value on engaging directly"" with staff.""We look forward to continuing on that path with our team in Coventry,"" it added.The GMB told the BBC it is considering trying again to get recognition at the Coventry site and that discussions are taking place about its strategy. The process would include persuading the Central Arbitration Committee, which is in charge of overseeing applications for recognition, that the pool of workers eligible to vote had changed.', 'The GMB, which lost by 28 votes, said its drive for recognition fell “agonisingly short” and accused Amazon of “union-busting”.It said there were “anti-union messages by company bosses, including multiple anti-union seminars” at the warehouse.It added that “the fire lit by workers in Coventry and across the UK is still burning”, and that the union would “carry on the fight”  for low paid workers.', ""The union's fight for recognition had been described as a David vs Goliath battle, with workers facing fierce resistance from the online giant.It began with a rag tag show of defiance in the summer of 2022, after Amazon offered workers a pay rise of between 35p and 50p an hour. Having toiled in warehouses during the Covid pandemic, workers said this felt like an insult, and in Coventry a small group of angry workers spontaneously walked out and protested outside the fulfilment centre. Then the GMB got involved and urged the workforce to unionise.In January 2023, with a GMB membership of just 50, Coventry workers held the first ever Amazon strike in the UK. "", 'It went on to organise a further 37 days of industrial action over the last year and by recruiting on the picket line, steadily built up its membership to more than 1,400 members out of the centre\'s estimated 3,000 plus workers.In April the union launched a legal challenge against Amazon, claiming it used underhand tactics to encourage members to cancel their union membership.On Wednesday it said that legal challenge would continue. As part of the challenge, the GMB says Amazon put up posters in fulfilment centres featuring QR codes that generated an email to the union’s membership department requesting that their membership be cancelled.Amazon responded saying that “employees were telling us they wanted to cancel their membership but could not find a way to do so, so we provided information to help. ""We have always been clear, that union membership is an employee’s personal choice.”', 'Amazon, which is one of the UK\'s largest private sector employers, with 75,000 workers, made it clear all along that it did not want to recognise a union and that it wanted to retain direct communication with its staff. After the vote on Wednesday, it further reiterated that “having daily conversations” with staff was “an essential part of our work culture”.“We value that direct relationship and so do our employees. This is why we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, act on their feedback, and invest heavily in great pay, benefits and skills development,"" the firm added.The GMB says it is surprised by what it sees as the fearlessness of an overwhelmingly immigrant workforce, many of whom arrived recently from South Asia. Union organisers estimate that as little as 5% of the Coventry employees are British born and its campaign leaflets were translated into 12 different languages. They say that in the beginning many were frightened to get involved but as the strikes wore on, and people saw that workers who’d joined picket lines weren’t facing disciplinary action, their confidence grew.The union is hopeful that the government will strengthen their power to organise. Labour has promised legislation in today\'s King\'s Speech to make it easier for unions to win recognition ballots by lowering the required threshold for victory and to make it easier for union officials to recruit in workplaces.', 'The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said that despite taking on one of the ""world\'s largest corporate giants"", the Coventry union members ""only narrowly missed out"" on securing recognition.""With Labour set to usher in a new era of stronger workers’ rights, companies like Amazon are on the wrong side of history,"" he added.But Gregor Gall, a professor of industrial relations at Glasgow university, questioned whether GMB had the resources to take the fight to other Amazon centres.""The cost of union organising is very high. The GMB had officers working full time on it. We won\'t necessarily see organising drives elsewhere,"" he said.Professor Gall\'s caution is understandable considering what has happened in the United States. In 2022 Amazon workers at its Staten Island warehouse in New York became the first in the US to win union recognition. Two years on, the company has still not sat down to negotiate with the union and continues to fight legal challenges to the vote.']"
Musk to move SpaceX and X HQ over gender identity law,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vd097z7rvo#0,Mr Musk wants to move his two high-profile firms from California to Texas over controversial new law.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 09:35:33 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.260504,"['Billionaire Elon Musk has said he will move the headquarters of two of his most high-profile companies, rocket firm SpaceX and social media platform X, from California to Texas.He said the move was due to recent laws passed by the state - in particular a new law which prevents schools from making rules requiring staff tell anyone, including parents, information about a child\'s gender identity.A spokesperson for the governor said the law keeps ""children safe while protecting the critical role of parents"".But Mr Musk called it ""the last straw"" in a post on his social media platform. The billionaire previously moved Tesla\'s headquarters to Texas in 2021 and he is a resident of the state - which has no income tax.The issue of what schools should tell parents about their children\'s gender identities has become a major topic of debate in the US.LGBTQ advocates say students have a right to privacy, but others argue parents have a right to know what is happening with their children. ""It protects the child-parent relationship by preventing politicians and school staff from inappropriately intervening in family matters and attempting to control if, when, and how families have deeply personal conversations,"" Brandon Richards told the Associated Press. Mr Musk, who has a transgender daughter, has previously said he ""supports trans"" while expressing impatience with pronouns - calling them an ""aesthetic nightmare"".The billionaire\'s daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson filed to cut ties with him in 2022.She said she no longer wanted to ""be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form"" when applying to legally change her name and gender.', 'Last year, Mr Musk said he would lobby to criminalise transgender medical treatment.""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" he said in a post on X on Tuesday, noting that he had previously expressed his opposition to the bill.California Governor Gavin Newsom criticised Mr Musk\'s decision on social media. “You bent the knee,” he posted, along with a screenshot of a 2022 post from Donald Trump which said Mr Musk would ""drop to [his] knees and beg"" if he asked.', 'States have historically competed aggressively to woo companies to establish headquarters, bringing with them high-paying corporate jobs. SpaceX, which employs more than 5,000 people in California, according to state records, also already has a large base of operations in Texas. In response to Mr Musk\'s pledge, Greg Abbott, governor for Texas, said: ""This cements Texas as the leader in space exploration.""Neither SpaceX nor X responded to requests for comment about whether the decision to move headquarters would lead to job cuts in California. The move comes after Mr Musk formally endorsed Donald Trump for president following the assassination attempt on him on Saturday.The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Mr Musk would be directing $45m a month toward his campaign.Mr Musk responded on X with a meme implying the report was false, though he later seemed to suggest there was some truth to the claim by responding positively to a post claiming he was pledging millions of dollars to help Trump get elected.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon.']"

"", ""Decisions on pay rises for NHS staff, teachers, police and prison guards in England have to be taken by the end of this month, when the official public sector pay review process for 2024-25 must be concluded.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that the government would need to find at least an extra £7bn per year to prevent the wages of these public sector workers falling further behind their counterparts in the private sector.Data from the IFS shows that while average private sector inflation-adjusted wages are around 4% higher than in 2010, public sector wages are still around 2.5% lower.The average pay for nurses is down 6.5% over that time, teachers’ wages are 9% lower and doctors' 15% lower.Finding £7bn per year extra would be very challenging given the government’s chosen fiscal rules, which restrain its spending and taxation powers.But if it fails to do this, it could find its targets to recruit more teachers and nurses even harder to achieve - or even risk provoking further public sector strikes."", ""Local authorities in England are in a financial crisis. Five have gone into effective bankruptcy since the start of 2023, forcing deep cuts to local services.And this situation is set to worsen.A survey of local authority leaders by the Local Government Information Unit earlier this year found around 28 local authorities - about one in 10 - were likely to have to effectively declare bankruptcy this financial year (2024-25).

But that would be expensive for the Treasury.They could allow local authorities to increase council tax even further.

The body also said elections across the world had increased ""uncertainty"" over economic growth amid concerns over ""significant swings"" in policy from new governments.The IMF maintained its forecast that the world economy will grow by 3.2% in 2024, but pointed towards slightly stronger growth in 2025 at 3.3%.It also confirmed an upgrade to the UK\'s outlook for 2024 to 0.7%, but kept its forecast for 2025 unchanged. It comes ahead of fresh UK inflation figures on Wednesday, which could help to determine whether the Bank of England cuts interest rates next month.The Bank has repeatedly put up interest rates to try to control inflation, creating pain for borrowers. Rates are currently at a 16-year high of 5.25%.UK inflation - which measures the pace of price rises - has fallen sharply since last year to 2%, in line with the Bank of England\'s official target. However, price rises in the important services sector remain high.IMF chief economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas said the UK was “in some ways similar” to the US in terms of sticky inflation.In its latest outlook update, the IMF said: ""The momentum on global disinflation is slowing, signalling bumps along the path.""The risk of elevated inflation has raised the prospects of higher-for-even-longer interest rates, which in turn increases external, fiscal, and financial risks.""However, on markets for UK government debt, the effective interest rate on a two-year gilt fell below 4% for the first time this year. This suggests increasing optimism that rates will be coming down soon.This is likely to continue the brewing mortgage price war, with fixed rates coming down even before the Bank makes its next rates decision on 1 August. ', 'While the IMF raised its global growth outlook for next year slightly, its forecast for  US growth in 2024 was downgraded to 2.6%, below the 2.7% forecast in April, due to a ""slower-than-expected start to the year"".The IMF said political uncertainty linked to elections around the world could affect its projections.It said it was “too early” to assess the economic policies of the new Labour government, but noted that some of Sir Kier Starmer\'s plans were in keeping with the IMF’s detailed advice in its annual review of the British economy.Separately it said that the “direction of travel” on US borrowing was of concern, as America\'s national debt continues to rise.Higher public borrowing tends to drive up government borrowing costs which can have a knock-on effect on mortgage rates and other consumer loans.     ""The potential for significant swings in economic policy as a result of elections this year, with negative spill-overs to the rest of the world, has increased the uncertainty around the baseline,"" the IMF said.It added that a rise in trade barriers such as export restrictions and tariffs also posed a risk to the global economy. More than 3,000 such measures were brought in last year, up from an already-high level of 1,000 in 2019.The IMF said these policies could trigger retaliation and a ""costly race to the bottom"".""We see an explosion in the number of trade restrictive measures,"" said Mr Gourinchas.""One concern we have is that going forward, this will weigh down on global activity.""']"

He is still employed by the company.He left school at 16, studied electronics at college and worked as a builder before joining ICL, which later became Fujitsu.His initial role on the Horizon team was supervising the machine which produced cryptographic keys to secure Horizon machines.But his duties soon expanded to providing witness statements in cases accusing sub-postmasters of theft and false accounting. This involved extracting audit record query data – detailing what keys had been pressed within Post Office branches – and records of calls to the Horizon helpdesk.One of his colleagues, who was more directly involved with the helpdesk queries, was not willing to give evidence as, according to Mr Dunks, she found the process ""a bit daunting"".And in Mr Dunks’ witness statement, he said that after the case of Mr Castleton case in 2006, the manager of the Software Support Centre (SSC) team Mik Peach “did not want any of his team to go to court"".Mr Peach sent an email after the trial saying ""the SSC [Software Support Centre, which operated the helpdesk] is NOT in position to undertake this role"".But Mr Dunks did provide witness statements, compiling them from pre-drafted paragraphs identified by capital letters, assembled following instructions from the Post Office. He was not able to tell the inquiry who originally drafted them.These covered the operation of the Horizon IT helpdesk, which he admitted having little knowledge of.In Mrs Misra’s case and others, he told courts that the numerous calls put in by sub-postmasters were not a sign that the counters were not working properly.Mrs Misra was eight weeks pregnant with her second child when she was sentenced to 15 months in prison in 2010.When giving opinions about helpdesk matters, Mr Dunks said he informed himself by conversations with SSC staff, often face-to-face, but that these conversations were not recorded by him.He was asked by barrister Flora Page if he was covering for the SSC ""because they were not prepared to stand up and defend Horizon in court"".“No, that’s not how it worked,” he replied.', 'During the hearing Mr Dunks was presented with emails which appeared to show the Fujitsu team taking a light-hearted approach to the prosecutions.In 2006, before he gave evidence in the Mr Castleton\'s case, his boss Peter Sewell wrote: ""That Castleton is a nasty chap and will be all out to rubbish the Fujitsu name. It’s up to you to maintain absolute strength and integrity no matter what the prosecution throw at you.""""Thank you for those very kind and encouraging words,"" replied Mr Dunks. ""I had to pause half way through reading it to wipe away a small tear.""Former sub-postmaster Mr Castleton was made bankrupt by the Post Office after a two year legal battle.At the inquiry, Mr Dunks denied that he was being sarcastic or joking, and said his manager was just trying to put him at ease.In 2002, the year he joined the security team, Mr Dunks was copied into an email from a Fujitsu staffer, Martin Riddell, congratulating the team on providing a witness statement to help to secure a conviction.""If I was a caring sharing manager I would buy a drink for everyone involved. But I\'m not. So I won’t,"" Mr Riddell wrote.']"
All water firms now investigated for sewage spills,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg5ev7e46mo#1,All 11 companies in England and Wales are now being probed after the regulator expands its investigation.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 14:36:39 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.261506,"['All 11 water and wastewater companies in England and Wales are now under scrutiny over sewage spills, after the regulator said it was expanding its investigation.On Tuesday, Ofwat opened enforcement cases into four more firms - Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy, Severn Trent and United Utilities - as part of its probe into how companies manage their sewage treatment works and networks.It began its investigation in 2021 and if found in breach the companies face being fined.Ofwat chief executive David Black said the latest move showed ""how concerned we are about the sector\'s environmental performance"".It comes a week after water firms hit back at Ofwat\'s proposal of a £19-a-year rise in bills to tackle problems including sewage leaks, with the companies saying the increase would not be enough.Water suppliers have faced increased scrutiny over their environmental and financial performance, as well as executive bonuses and pay.In May, the BBC found that millions of litres of raw sewage were illegally pumped into one of England\'s most famous lakes, Windermere in the Lake District, after a fault, and that United Utilities failed to stop what was found to be illegal pollution.Every major English water company has reported data suggesting they have discharged raw sewage when the weather is dry - a practice which is potentially illegal.Water companies can release untreated sewage into rivers and seas when it rains to prevent it flooding homes, but such spills are illegal when it is dry.Announcing the four firms facing new enforcement action, Ofwat said its investigation had highlighted its ""concerns that these companies may not be fulfilling their obligations to protect the environment and minimise pollution"".The regulator already has enforcement cases against Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, South West Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water.Southern Water also remains subject to enforcement monitoring following a previous case in 2019, Ofwat said. It was fined £90m in 2021 after pleading guilty to 6,971 ""unpermitted sewage discharges"".', '""Where we find that companies have breached their obligations, we will continue to act - over recent years, we have imposed penalties and payments of over £300m on water and wastewater companies,"" said Mr Black.United Utilities said in a statement: ""We understand and share people\'s concerns about the health of the environment and the operation of wastewater systems"".A spokesperson for Hafren Dyfrdwy said the firm would ""ensure that we will not be the reason for any unhealthy rivers in Wales by 2030"" and would be ""rapidly reducing"" polluting spills.Severn Trent said it recently announced a programme worth £1bn to reduce its impact on rivers to ""almost zero by 2030"".Dŵr Cymru said it  ""will not shy away from the challenges facing us"".Last year, the Environment Agency said in its annual review that the number of serious pollution incidents was ""unacceptably high"", and that water companies needed to go ""further and faster"".']"

"Royal Mail will deliver letters forever, vows buyer",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngjx9nn92o#1,Daniel Kretinsky says he will not walk away from the Universal Service Obligation to deliver letters.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 09:49:07 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.262229,"['The prospective new owner of Royal Mail has said he will not walk away from the requirement to deliver letters throughout the UK six days a week, as long as he is running the service.""As long as I\'m alive, I completely exclude this,"" Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky told the BBC.Mr Kretinsky has had a £3.6bn offer for Royal Mail accepted by its board.Shareholders are expected to approve the deal in the coming months, but the government also has a say over whether it goes ahead.', 'Currently the Universal Service Obligation (USO) requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week throughout the country for the same price. But questions have been raised over whether the service could be reduced in the future.In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Kretinsky also said he would be willing to share profits with employees, if given the go-ahead to buy the group.However, he appeared to reject the idea of employees having a stake in Royal Mail, which unions have called for in exchange for their support.The Royal Mail board agreed a £3.6bn takeover offer from Mr Kretinsky in May for the 500-year-old organisation, which employs more than 150,000 people. Including assumed debts, the offer is worth £5bn.But because Royal Mail is a nationally important company, the government has the power to scrutinise and potentially block the deal.', 'As well as keeping the new government on side, Mr Kretinsky also faces the task of convincing postal unions that the proposed deal will benefit employees.The USO is a potential sticking point for both the government and unions.Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK for a fixed price.How well this has actually been working in practice is a different matter. Ten years ago, 92% of first class post arrived on time. By the end of last year it was down to 74%, according to the regulator Ofcom.Last year the regulator fined Royal Mail £5.6m for failing to meet its delivery targets.Royal Mail has been pushing for this obligation to be watered down. It wants to cut second class letter deliveries to every other weekday, saying this will save £300m, and lead to ""fewer than 1,000"" voluntary redundancies.', 'Mr Kretinsky has committed in writing to honouring the USO, but only for five years.And after that, in theory, the new owners could just walk away from it.However, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC: ""As long as I\'m alive, I completely exclude this, and I\'m sure that anybody that would be my successor would absolutely understand this.""I say this as an absolutely clear, unconditional commitment: Royal Mail is going to be the provider of Universal Service Obligation in the UK, I would say forever, as long as the service is going to be needed, and as long as we are going to be around.""Mr Kretinsky added that the written five-year commitment was ""the longest commitment that has ever been offered in a situation like this"".', 'Another potential stumbling block for the deal, however, is how the company will be structured.Unions would like to see the company renationalised, but Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), told the BBC that would be ""difficult in the current political and economic environment"".Instead, what the CWU is pushing for is ""a different model of ownership"" - that is, where the employees part-own the business.To get its support for the takeover, the union wants employees to share ownership of the company, along with other concessions including board representation for workers.It says profit sharing is ""not going to be enough to deliver our support and the support of the workforce"".', 'If the union doesn\'t get what it wants, it won\'t rule out industrial action, Mr Ward said. Its members went on strike in 2022 and 2023.Although Mr Kretinsky said he is ""very open"" to profit sharing, he is not in favour of shared ownership.""I don\'t think the ownership stake is the right model,"" he said. ""The logic is: share of profit, yes, [but an] ownership structure creates a lot of complexity.""For instance, what happens if the employee leaves? He has shares, he is leaving, he is not working for the company, he [still] needs remunerating.""Mr Kretinsky said he didn\'t want to create ""some anonymous structure"" but instead ""remunerate the people who are working for the company, and creating value for the company"".The union is also concerned about job losses and changes to the terms and conditions of postal workers\' contracts.Mr Kretinsky has guaranteed no compulsory redundancies or changes in terms and conditions but only until 2025.""If we are more successful, and we have more parcels to be delivered, we need not less people, but we need more people,"" he said. ""So really, job cuts are not part of our plan at all.""', 'He said if the management, union and employees work together, ""we will be successful"".Another concern is the potential break-up of the business.The profit for Royal Mail\'s parent company last year was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, GLS. Royal Mail itself made a loss. Mr Kretinsky has promised not to split off GLS or load the parent company with excessive debt, although borrowings will rise if the deal goes through.But he has a way to go to convince the CWU.""I can\'t think of any other country in the world that would just just hand over its entire postal service to an overseas equity investor,"" Mr Ward of the CWU said.However, Mr Kretinsky said that the postal unions ""do understand that we are on the same ship, and that we need this ship to be successful, and that if we are there,  we don\'t have any real problems to deal with, because the sky is blue, and it\'s blue for everybody.""The union cannot stop this deal but the government can block it under the National Security and Investment Act. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said he will scrutinise the assurances and guarantees given and called on Mr Kretinsky to work constructively with the unions.Mr Kretinsky may say that he and the unions are ultimately on the same ship but, as things stand, they are not on the same page.', ""Daniel Kretinsky started his career as a lawyer in his hometown of Brno, before moving to Prague.He then made serious money in Central and Eastern European energy interests.This includes Eustream, which transports Russian gas via pipelines that run through Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.He then diversified into other investments, including an almost 10% stake in UK supermarket chain Sainsbury's and a 27% share in Premier League club West Ham United.The Czech businessman is worth about £6bn, according to reports.""]"

North Sea operators warned to step up decommissioning,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxr20270x50o#1,The North Sea Transition Authority says operators must leave the marine environment clean and safe when they stop producing.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 05:28:13 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.262897,"['Oil and gas operators have been warned by regulators to step up decommissioning in the North Sea.The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) wants companies to clean up their oil and gas legacy and said it was ""getting tough"" on operators not meeting their regulatory obligations.Repeated delays to well plugging and abandonment - where wells are plugged with concrete to protect groundwater resources and prevent surface pollution and methane emission - were pushing up the estimated bill for decommissioning on the UK Continental Shelf, the NSTA said.The facts have been laid out in the NSTA\'s latest decommissioning cost and performance update.It comes after Pauline Innes, the NSTA’s supply chain and decommissioning director, warned licensees last November to make headway on the plugging and abandonment of wells. She warned that those failing to comply would be held to account.', 'Now the regulator has begun investigations into alleged failures to complete timely plugging and abandonment in line with approved plans.Operators are legally required to leave the marine environment clean and safe when they stop producing, and must decommission their platforms, pipelines and wells - a complex and expensive process which requires thorough preparation and planning.Taking too long, or deferring work, adds to the cost and can mean that platforms continue to use power and release emissions even though they are no longer producing oil and gas.The removal of spent structures from the North Sea is expensive for the oil and gas industry, but was seen as an opportunity for a growing sector.Operators expect to spend about £24bn on decommissioning between 2023 and 2032, up £3bn on the forecast for the same period in last year’s report. Hundreds of wells will need to be decommissioned every year as more oil and gas fields shut down. However, operators only achieved 70% of planned well decommissioning activities last year.', 'The NSTA said some operators were deferring in the hope that prices would fall, but failing to award contracts reduces the supply chain’s revenues and ability to invest in capacity and resources. Ms Innes said: ""With spending forecast to peak at £2.5bn per year in the current decade, decommissioning can ensure that the UK’s world-leading supply chain is equipped to help operators clean up their oil and gas infrastructure over the next 50 years and support the carbon storage sector, which will rely on many of the same resources.""I am concerned that this huge opportunity to safeguard highly-skilled jobs and support the transition will be wasted if operators fail to tackle their well decommissioning backlogs.""She added: ""The supply chain wants to do this work, but it is not physically tied to the UK.""Its skills and resources are in demand in other regions, and we are starting to see companies marketing their rigs elsewhere. ""Operators need to use the supply chain, now, or risk losing it.""Offshore Energies UK said it was a ""complex multi-billion-pound process"" which involved detailed technical preparation and planning.Ricky Thomson, the trade body\'s decommissioning manager, said: ""Efficient decommissioning continues to be an industry priority.""We need a collaborative effort to achieve safe, efficient and effective decommissioning.""Around 12,000 offshore oil and gas platforms worldwide which are nearing the end of their operational lives need to be decommissioned and the UK will continue to be a global leader at the forefront of this effort.""']"

Kaspersky, which had been operating in the US for two decades, has denied the allegations.""Starting from July 20, 2024 Kaspersky will gradually wind down its US operations and eliminate US-based positions,"" the firm said in a statement. Its US website has already stopped selling its antivirus and cybersecurity tools, with a message reading ""purchase is unavailable for US customers"".The announcement came after sales and distribution of Kaspersky products were banned in the US.Ms Raimondo said the US was compelled to take action due to Russia\'s ""capacity and... intent to collect and weaponise the personal information of Americans"".""Kaspersky will generally no longer be able to, among other activities, sell its software within the United States or provide updates to software already in use,"" the Commerce Department said.The ruling used broad powers created by the Trump administration to ban or restrict transactions between US firms and technology companies from ""foreign adversary"" nations like Russia and China.It effectively barred downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the products from 29 September, while new business was to be restricted within 30 days of the announcement.Sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department.According to the Commerce Department, the Moscow-headquartered multinational company has offices in 31 countries around the world, servicing more than 400 million users and 270,000 corporate clients in more than 200 countries.At the time Kaspersky said it intended to pursue ""all legally available options"" to fight the ban, and denied it engaged in any activity that threatened US security.']"

Shares of its predecessor company started rallying in January, after Mr Trump defeated Republican challengers in the primaries. The price soared further after Trump Media formally debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange in March. But shares slumped at the start of his criminal trial in April, in which he was later convicted of fraud charges linked to hush-money that was paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels.The current share price remains below levels seen in March.

""China’s economy hit the brakes in the June quarter,"" said Heron Lim at Moody\'s Analytics, adding that analysts are hoping for solutions from the meeting under way in Beijing, also called the Third Plenum. The world\'s second-largest economy is facing a prolonged property crisis, steep local government debt, weak consumption and high unemployment.Past outcomes of the Plenum have changed the course of history in China - in 1978, then leader Deng Xiaoping began opening China\'s markets to the world, and in 2013 President Xi Jinping hinted at loosening the controversial one-child policy.  And so there are expectations of this year\'s Plenum, where  Mr Xi is presiding over a closed-door gathering of 370-plus high-ranking Chinese Communist Party members. The rhetoric on state-controlled media has certainly been encouraging.  An editorial in The Global Times said a ""wide range of reform-focused polices"" are ""high on the agenda"" and would usher in a ""new chapter"". Xinhua referred to ""comprehensive"" and ""unprecedented"" reforms. The editorial in the People\'s Daily was headlined on a ""new era of reform and opening up"", invoking the very phrase Deng coined in 1978. Observers, however, are unsure of how much room there is for bold ideas or debate in the Party under Mr Xi\'s heavily-centralised leadership. Some see the meeting as a mere rubber-stamping exercise for decisions that have already been made.Economists are also sceptical the meeting will deliver a quick fix. It has ""little impact on near-term growth,"" says Qian Wang, Asia Pacific chief economist at Vanguard, because its focus will be on longer-term and more significant reforms to ""unleash the long-term growth potential"". Still, analysts will be watching for announcements that signal the Party\'s economic priorities. ', 'Separate data on Monday showed that prices for new homes in June fell at the fastest pace in nine years.  This is more evidence of the crisis that has engulfed China\'s property sector and led to the demise of giants such as Evergrande. The fear is that it could spread to other parts of the economy.""There are more than 4,000 banks in China and over 90% are smaller, regional banks which are highly exposed to the housing market and local government debt,"" says Shanghai-based economist Dan Wang.She believes Party leaders will  ""push for consolidation of small banks"". Another issue is falling prices - a symptom of weak demand.Producer prices continued to drop in the last month, while consumer prices rose by a mere 0.2%, the slowest pace in three months.Meanwhile, retail sales in June grew by just 2%, which is below expectations and a sign that consumers are still cautious about spending and uncertain of the future.  ""A major concern is the loss of household, business, and investor confidence in the government’s ability to navigate the perilous economic environment,"" said Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund\'s China division.Still, questions remain about Beijing\'s willingness to deliver the sort of solution that would satisfy observers and the markets. ""The government is reluctant to turn to short-term stimulus plans such as cash transfer to families,"" Dan Wang said. ""Instead, we expect them to stress once again on bolstering supply chains and high tech."" That is in line with Beijing\'s bets on high-tech industries such as renewable energy, artificial intelligence and chip-making, and exports to revive the economy. Last month, China reported a record trade surplus - $99bn (£76.4bn) - as exports soared and imports struggled. But even that bet faces challenging odds. Major trading partners such as the European Union and the United States have imposed tariffs and other barriers on goods made in China, from electric vehicles to advanced chips.']"
She's made her opening gambit. What's the chancellor's long game?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjw6l53xe2o#1,"Once a junior chess champion, now Rachel Reeves runs the UK economy. Faisal Islam looks at her strategy.","Sun, 14 Jul 2024 02:44:57 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.263950,"['Rachel Reeves\' favourite chess move is the Sicilian Defence.It\'s an opening move designed to open up the board for later in the game - and one the chancellor used often as a junior chess champion. It\'s “particularly good when you want to go on the attack,"" she suggests.Growing up, Reeves was driven around the country by her parents to compete and beat privately educated boys, often as the only state school-educated girl. The story has echoes of the fictitious chess prodigy Beth Harmon - the lead character in Netflix show The Queen’s Gambit, of which Reeves is a fan - playing out entire imaginary chess games on her bedroom ceiling, several moves ahead.At No 11, Reeves is now applying the mathematics of constantly changing trade-offs to running the country’s economy.', 'As she told me at her general election count, four hours after the exit poll had dropped, “there’s not a huge amount of money there” and therefore she was “willing to have a fight” on ripping up red tape holding back the private sector from building new homes and rebuilding Britain’s infrastructure.In the 72 hours that followed, Treasury officials worked through the weekend to put together Labour’s planning shake-up as part of a big bang announcement to communicate directly to business leaders.It was designed to show total commitment to the growth agenda. Two green-belt data centres that had been blocked by local councils were given planning permission. Two house-building projects were unlocked, too.In her first speech as chancellor, Reeves was stressing to investors that Labour was willing to use its landslide election majority to take politically controversial steps that would not have been possible under even a stable version of the previous government. The presence of so many members of the cabinet at the speech was meant to signal an end to the years of soap opera, psychodrama and unstable personality politics.Reeves wants the Treasury to be about more than tax and spend. It will be the “growth department” too, with the peer Spencer Livermore, now effectively her deputy for growth, alongside the Chief Secretary Darren Jones, who will focus on tax.With her first announcements, she wants to convey an optimistic path for the UK that is attractive to investors. ', ""Those in the room for her first speech as chancellor seemed enthused enough. In private, top business people have told me that stability of strategy, policy and the ministers in charge would indeed represent a huge change. But the proof will be in the new investments, the spades in the ground, and eventually the number of wind turbines and new houses.The hope is to not just accept the difficult situation on borrowing, tax and spend, but to “improve the trade-offs”, the chancellor says, again showing her chess thinking.The more confident investors are in Labour’s plans, the more money will pour in, and the more tangible improvements in the economy will be. The  government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has previously given credit to policies that it expects to boost the economy, for example factoring in former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s childcare policy into its growth forecasts. If it does the same for Reeves' planning policies, there might be less pressure for spending cuts and tax rises.In next week’s King’s Speech there will be new legislation enhancing the independence and role of the OBR, which Liz Truss infamously and disastrously sidelined at her mini-Budget.Later in the month, the chancellor will publish some details on the state of the public finances. This could help set early parameters for big tax and spending numbers in the autumn.  "", 'She has already said she will be tough on adhering to rules designed to limit borrowing for day-to-day spending. Currently, Reeves would need to make some very tough choices, potentially cutting spending on councils, prisons and courts and raising some taxes to do this.This will come to a head in an autumn Budget and Spending Review.When pushed on whether she can really deliver a step-change to housebuilding, infrastructure and energy investment, while her government continues cuts to public investment planned by the Conservatives, Reeves is defiant.“We need the private sector to build homes, we are not going to be in the business of constructing homes ourselves,” she replied,The more the private sector steps up, the better these difficult trade-offs will get - with more money from outside, the less the government will have to make difficult decisions on spending cuts or tax rises.Conversely, if the private sector is expected to do not just the heavy lifting but all the lifting on investment to power growth, it gives it strong leverage over policy.For example, Labour says it will deliver 1.5 million new homes over this parliament, but what will it do if housebuilders ask which construction workers will build such homes? How will it answer the energy firms saying that regulator Ofgem needs to free up regional pricing of electricity so that Scotland can benefit with cheap or even free energy arising from its surplus wind power? The question is: what is Reeves prepared to sacrifice in order to meet Labour’s “number one” growth mission?', ""Looming large over Reeves' decisions is a desire not to create an overbearing strategy that leverages its power over the purse strings to dictate policy, as occurred on occasion in Gordon Brown’s Treasury.The chancellor’s colleagues say now the “weight of opposition” has been lifted from her shoulders, she can now focus on changing policy.Rachel Reeves’ team says her chess-like strategy is to fix foundations first, then to rebuild Britain, and then to make every part of the UK better off. Her first moves this week show that she and her government are playing a rather long game.Top picture: Getty Images"", 'BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

How AI is fuelling uncertainty for game developers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl44mv0jnv5o#2,In a struggling games industry AI has been hailed as a possible saviour. But not everyone's convinced.,"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 23:05:46 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264066,"['""I\'m very aware that I could wake up tomorrow and my job could be gone,” says Jess Hyland.The video game artist says the industry she’s spent almost 15 years working in is on “shaky” ground at the moment.A boom in players and profits during the pandemic sparked a flurry of investments, expansions and acquisitions that, in hindsight, now look short-sighted.Gaming remains profitable, but thousands of workers worldwide have lost their jobs, and successful studios have been shut down over the past two years.More closures and cuts are feared.""Everyone knows someone who\'s been laid off. There\'s lots of worry about the future,"" says Jess.Some bosses are talking up the potential of generative AI - the tech behind tools such as ChatGPT - as a potential saviour.Tech giant Nvidia has shown off impressive development tool prototypes, and gaming industry heavyweights such as Electronic Arts and Ubisoft are investing in the tech.It\'s claimed AI tools can save development time, free workers up to focus on creativity and provide a more personalised user experience.With budgets at the blockbuster end of the industry spiralling as audience expectations rise with them, it sounds like a perfect solution.But not to everyone.', '""The people who are most excited about AI enabling creativity aren\'t creatives,"" says Jess, a member of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain\'s game workers branch. She sits on its artificial intelligence working group. Against the backdrop of widespread layoffs, Jess says the suspicion among workers is that bosses see AI as a path to cutting costs when labour is their biggest expense.Jess says she knows one person who\'s lost work due to AI, and has heard of it happening to others.There are also dozens of accounts online suggesting that jobs in concept art and other traditionally entry-level roles have been affected.Most firms making AI tools insist they\'re not designed to replace humans, and there\'s broad agreement that the technology is a long way from being able to do so.Jess says the bigger worry is that ""jobs are going to change, but not in a good way"".Rather than creating their own material, says Jess, artists worry they could end up supplementing AI\'s efforts, rather than the other way around.', 'Publicly available AI image generators, for example, can quickly output impressive-looking results from simple text prompts, but are famously poor at rendering hands. They can also struggle with chairs.""The stuff that AI generates, you become the person whose job is fixing it,"" says Jess. ""It\'s not why I got into making games."" Gaming is a multibillion-dollar business but it\'s also an artistic medium that brings together artists, musicians, writers, programmers and actors, to name just some.A frequent concern is that AI will serve to minimise, rather than enable, the work of those creatives.', 'It\'s a view echoed by Chris Knowles, a former senior engine developer at UK gaming firm Jagex, known for its Runescape title.""If you\'re going to have to hire actual human artists to fix the output, why not harness their creativity and make something new that connects with players?"" he says.Chris, who now runs UK indie studio Sidequest Ninja, says that in his experience smaller developers are generally unenthusiastic about using generative AI.One of his concerns is around cloned games.Online game stores - where indie developers make most of their sales - are rife with imitations of original titles. This is especially true of mobile games, says Chris, and there are studios set up ""entirely to churn out clones"".It\'s not yet possible to rip off a whole game using AI, he says, but copying assets such as artwork is easily done.""Anything that makes the clone studios\' business model even cheaper and quicker makes the difficult task of running a financially sustainable indie studio even harder,"" says Chris. He also points to the huge amounts of electricity required to run generative AI systems as a big concern. ', 'Copyright concerns over generative AI - currently the subject of several ongoing legal cases - are one of the biggest barriers to its wider use in gaming right now.Tools are trained on vast quantities of text and pictures scraped from the internet and, like many artists, Jess believes it amounts to ""mass copyright infringement"".Some studios are exploring systems trained on internal data, and third parties advertising ethical tools that claim to work off authorised sources are springing up.Even then, the fear is that AI will be used to turn out assets such as artwork and 3D models at scale, and the expectation on workers will be to produce more output.""The more content you can make, the more money you can make,"" says Jess.', 'Some in the industry are more positive about AI.Composer Borislav Slavov, who won a Bafta Games Award for his work on Baldur\'s Gate 3, told the BBC he was ""excited about what AI could bring to the table for music in the near future"".Speaking at the recent Games Music Festival in London, he said he believed it would enable composers to ""explore music directions faster"" and push them out of their comfort zones.""This would allow the composers to focus way more on the essence - getting inspired and composing deeply emotional and strong themes,"" he said.However, he did agree that AI could not ""replace the human soul and spirit"".While she has serious personal reservations about using the tech to ""automate creativity"", Jess says she wouldn\'t be against using it to bear the burden of some of the more repetitive admin tasks that are a feature of most projects.', 'The AI industry is currently trying to reassure governments and regulators over concerns about its future use, as shown by a recent law passed by the EUIt will also have to work hard to win over another group - gamers.Online shooter The Finals received a backlash over its use of synthesised voice lines, and developer Square Enix was criticised for the limited use of generated art in its multiplayer game Foamstars.Jess believes growing talk about AI has made gamers ""think about what they love about games and what\'s special about that - sharing experiences crafted by other humans"".""I\'m still putting something of myself into it and I think there\'s a growing recognition of that.""Indie developer Chris adds: ""If you train a generative model on nothing but cave paintings, all it\'ll ever give you will be cave paintings. ""It takes humans to get from there to the Sistine Chapel.""Additional reporting by Laura Cress.']"
Is Brazil's Brics-building worth it?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0venrydg8yo#2,The Brazilian president sees the Brics as a way to remake the world - but it is dominated by China.,"Sun, 14 Jul 2024 23:09:43 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264177,"['It\'s been more than a year-and-a-half since Brazil\'s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva returned to the country\'s presidency, back from the political dead after his conviction on corruption charges was dramatically annulled.In that time, President Lula\'s comeback has given renewed force to one of the world\'s most unlikely economic alliances - the Brics, a grouping that unites Brazil with Russia, India, China and South Africa.In his previous time as president from 2003 to 2010, Lula was instrumental in efforts to weld the Brics into a geopolitical entity, and an emerging counterweight to the West.Now the bloc has momentum on its side once again. It\'s come to be known as Brics Plus, after the original members agreed at a watershed summit in Johannesburg in August last year to admit a handful of new joiners, including Saudi Arabia and Iran.Not bad for a grouping that was originally willed into being by sheer high-concept financial whimsy, the brainchild of economist Jim O\'Neill, who saw it more as an  investment opportunity than a new gang of nations.""When the Brics were invented, it was pretty much an asset class,"" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.""But it caught on in Brazil, because it directly spoke to Lula\'s aspirations in foreign policy.""', 'At the Johannesburg meeting, Lula was particularly bullish about the group\'s long-term economic prospects.“We have already surpassed the G7 and account for 32% of global GDP in purchasing power parity,"" he said. ""Projections indicate that emerging and developing markets will be those that will show the highest growth rate in the coming years,"" he went on. ""This shows that the dynamism of the economy is in the global south and the Brics is its driving force.”', 'But that is disingenuous on Lula\'s part, to say the least. As has been pointed out by the originator of the Bric acronym, who now rejoices in the title of Baron O\'Neill of Gatley, all the economic growth in the group has actually come from Xi Jinping\'s China and Narendra Modi\'s India.""None of the other Brics has performed anywhere near as well as those two,"" he said in an article written in reaction to the bloc\'s expansion.""Brazil and Russia account for around the same share of global GDP as they did in 2001, and South Africa is not even the largest economy in Africa [Nigeria has surpassed it]."" As he also points out, China ""dominates the Brics by being twice the size of all the others combined"", in much the same way that the US dominates the G7.', 'So what does slow-growth Brazil gain from being dragged along in China\'s economic slipstream? Rodrigo Zeidan, a Brazilian economist based at China\'s New York University Shanghai, tells the BBC that Brazil and China alike see the Brics as a ""hedge"" in terms of global alliances, rather than as a top priority.""The Brics right now, for Brazil, cost almost nothing,"" he says. ""So if the benefits are not high, it\'s fine. They are neither a big benefit nor a hindrance.""Since China is its biggest trading partner, Brazil is comfortable maintaining close relations with Beijing, even if the Brics grouping provides it with some ""strange bedfellows"", as Mr Zeidan puts it.Lula has certainly maintained an ambiguous position on Russia\'s war in Ukraine, but that is more due to Brazil\'s traditional neutrality in foreign policy than to a wish to support a fellow Brics nation.For Monica de Bolle at the Peterson Institute, herself a Brazilian economist, President Lula showed ""a lot of naivety"" in committing to the Brics because of his belief in furthering relations among the big so-called global south nations.As a result, Brazil has now acquired ""a China dependency"" that could harm it in other foreign policy relations, she says.""If you are in the US, you know that the US stance on China is not going to change [whoever wins the presidential election in November],"" she adds.""In either case, it\'s moving in the direction of greater anti-China sentiment. At some point, that\'s going to create additional reactions from China, which could put Brazil in a very difficult position, because it\'s perceived as being aligned with China.""', 'One tangible gain for Brazil from the alliance comes in the shape of the New Development Bank (NDB), a multilateral lender founded by the Brics and described by Lula as ""a milestone in effective collaboration between emerging economies"".It is currently headed by Brazilian ex-President Dilma Rousseff. She was President Lula\'s political protegee, and succeeded him in 2011. But her time in office came to a chaotic end when she was impeached in 2016 for breaking budgetary laws.The NDB has not only returned her to public life, but since the bank\'s headquarters are in Shanghai, it makes her key to maintaining links between Brazil and China.""Dilma is definitely huge in terms of political image. Having Dilma here in Shanghai is very important for strengthening Brazil-China relations,"" says Mr Zeidan.Brazil has also benefited directly from NDB money. In June, Ms Rousseff and Brazilian Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin signed a loan deal worth more than $1.1bn (£880m) to help pay for reconstruction after widespread floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.Regarding the NDB and Russia, the bank put all transactions involving the country on hold in March 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And the NDB has complied with international sanctions against Russia.But Russia is due to take over the rotating presidency of the bank in mid-2025 and there is some uncertainty over what will happen then.In the meantime, Ms Rousseff is not averse to attending financial gatherings in Russia, and shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has praised her work at the helm of the NDB.', 'President Lula is a passionate advocate of the Brics as a means of reforming global governance and giving a greater voice to the developing world. He has criticised the ""paralysis"" of global institutions, while praising the expansion of the Brics as strengthening the fight for more diverse perspectives.But other observers retort that the Brics are themselves paralysed by their own internal contradictions, with Russia at war in Ukraine, while China and India have their own mutual squabbles.Ultimately, says Ms de Bolle in Washington, the Brics are ""a heterogeneous group of countries that have nothing in common, apart from the fact that they are big"".""The Brics have no clear agenda that has any real weight,"" agrees Mr Zeidan in Shanghai. ""Right now, China doesn\'t ask much of Brazil. However, anything that China asks, Brazil does.""It\'s fine to be part of the Brics when the stakes are low. But what if the stakes rise?""In other words, the effect of the Brics, on Brazil and on the world, may be minor for now. But if China decides to become more assertive, that could change rapidly - and Brazil could be faced with some uncomfortable choices.']"

But now everyone pays with UPI. Scan the code and the payment is done within seconds.""No issues of handling cash, giving change to customers. It has made my life and business smooth,” he says.', ""UPI, or to give it its full name the Unified Payments Interface, was launched in 2016  in a collaboration between India's central bank and the nation's banking industry.It's an app-based instant payment system, which allows users to send and receive money, pay bills and authorise payments in a single step - no need to enter bank details or any other personal information. And, perhaps most importantly, it's free.It has become so popular that India is now the biggest real-time payments market.In May, UPI recorded 14 billion transactions, up from nine billion the year before. "", 'But the popularity and ease of use has made it a rich feeding ground for scammers.“While digital payments are convenient, they do come with vulnerabilities,"" says Shashank Shekhar, founder of the Delhi-based Future Crime Research Foundation.Mr Shekhar says that scammers use a variety of ways to trick people, including persuading them to share their UPI pin number, which is needed to authorise payments.Some scammers have also created fake UPI apps, that are clones of legitimate banking apps, and then steal login details or other valuable information.""The pace at which digital transformation took place in the country means unfortunately digital literacy and safe internet practice could not catch up,"" says Mr Shekhar.He says that between January 2020 and June 2023 almost half of all financial fraud involved the use of the UPI system.According to government figures there were more than 95,000 cases of fraud involving UPI in the financial year ending April 2023, up from 77,000 in the previous year.', 'Shivkali was one such victim. She had always wanted to own a scooter, but they were beyond her budget.However, earlier in the year the 22-year-old, who lives in Bihar state in northeastern India, spotted one for sale on Facebook that looked like a great deal.""I grabbed the opportunity without thinking,"" she says. A couple of clicks later and she was talking to the owner, who said that for $23 he would send over the vehicle papers.That went smoothly, so Shivkali continued to send the owner money, via instant transfers. She eventually ended up paying $200, but the scooter (also commonly called a Scooty in India), was never delivered.Shivkali realised she had been scammed.""I did not think I could be cheated, as I have some education background and know what is happing in the world. But scammers are smart. They have an art of speaking to convince the opposite person,” she says.The government and the central bank are looking at ways to protect UPI users from scammers.But at the moment, if a victim wants compensation, they have to approach their bank.“The problem is deep rooted,"" says Dr Durgesh Pandey, an expert in financial crime.""Most of the onus lies with banks and telecom companies. They are lax in making identity checks, that’s why the fraudster can’t be traced.""But the challenge for banks particularly is that they have to balance between inclusivity, ease of business and enforcement of identity checks. If they are too rigid, the vulnerable section of society will remain without banking facilities.”But Dr Pandey argues that in most cases of fraud, the bank is not totally to blame.“It’s a complex question because the problem lies with banks, but it’s the victim who is giving his credentials in most case. I would say both victim and bank should bear the loss.”', 'Despite those problems, UPI is being promoted in rural areas where access to banking services can be difficult.Poonam Untwal from Rajasthan runs a guidance centre which helps people use the internet and digital banking.""Most of us are not that educated, nor know the proper use of smartphones.

Now we can receive and send money with UPI. People who don’t have smart phones come to my centre to get their transactions done,"" she says.As well as making inroads into rural areas, UPI is spreading overseas.Retailers in Bhutan, Mauritius, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and UAE will take UPI payments.

Will K-pop's AI experiment pay off?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngr3r0914o#2,"Some of the genre's biggest names are now using artificial intelligence, but fans are divided.","Tue, 16 Jul 2024 08:31:00 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264531,"['There’s an issue dividing K-pop fans right now - artificial intelligence.Several of the genre’s biggest stars have now experimented with the technology to create music videos and produce songs, including boy band Seventeen.Last year the South Korean group sold around 16 million albums, making them one of the most successful K-pop acts in history. But it’s their most recent album and single, Maestro, that’s got people talking.The music video features an AI-generated scene, and at the launch of the album in Seoul, one of the band members, Woozi, told reporters he was ""experimenting"" with AI when making music.“We practised making songs with AI, as we want to develop along with technology rather than complain about it,"" he said.""This is a technological development that we have to leverage, not just be dissatisfied with. I practised using AI and tried to look for the pros and cons.”However, Woozi has since said on Instagram that all of Seventeen\'s music is “written and composed by human creators”.', 'On K-pop discussion pages, fans were torn over the issue of using AI, with some saying more regulations need to be in place before the technology becomes normalised.Others were more open to it, including super fan Ashley Peralta. ""If AI can help an artist overcome creative blocks, then that’s OK with me,"" says the 26-year-old.Her worry though, is that a whole album of AI generated lyrics means fans will lose touch with their favourite musicians.""I love it when music is a reflection of an artist and their emotions,"" she says. ""K-pop artists are much more respected when they’re hands on with choreographing, lyric writing and composing, because you get a piece of their thoughts and feelings.""AI can take away that crucial component that connects fans to the artists.""Ashley presents Spill the Soju, a K-pop fan podcast, with her best friend Chelsea Toledo. Chelsea admires Seventeen for being a self-producing group, which means they write their own songs and choreograph them too, but she’s worried about AI having an impact on that reputation.“If they were to put out an album that’s full of lyrics they hadn’t personally written, I don’t know if it would feel like Seventeen any more and fans want music that is authentically them”.', ""For those working in K-Pop production, it’s no surprise that artists are embracing new technologies.Chris Nairn is a producer, composer and songwriter working under the name Azodi. Over the past 12 years he’s written songs for K-pop artists including Kim Woojin and leading agency SM Entertainment.Working with K-pop stars means Chris, who lives in Brighton, has spent a lot of time in South Korea, whose music industry he describes as progressive.“What I've learned by hanging out in Seoul is that Koreans are big on innovation, and they're very big on ‘what's the next thing?’, and asking, ‘how can we be one step ahead?’ It really hit me when I was there,” he says.“So, to me, it's no surprise that they're implementing AI in lyric writing, it's about keeping up with technology.”"", 'Is AI the future of K-pop? Chris isn’t so sure. As someone who experiments with AI lyric generators, he doesn’t feel the lyrics are strong enough for top artists.“AI is putting out fairly good quality stuff, but when you\'re at the top tier of the songwriting game, generally, people who do best have innovated and created something brand new. AI works by taking what’s already been uploaded and therefore can’t innovate by itself.”If anything, Chris predicts AI in K-pop will increase the demand for more personal songs.""There\'s going to be pressure from fans to hear lyrics that are from the artist\'s heart, and therefore sound different to any songs made using AI”.', 'Seventeen aren’t the only K-pop  band experimenting with AI. Girl group Aespa, who have several AI members as well as human ones, also used the technology in their latest music video. Supernova features generated scenes where the faces of band members remain still as only their mouths move.Podcaster and super-fan Chelsea says it ""triggered"" a lot of people.“K-pop is known for amazing production and editing, so having whole scenes made of AI takes away the charm,"" she adds.Chelsea also worries about artists not getting the right credit. “With AI in videos it’s harder to know if someone’s original artwork has been stolen, it’s a really touchy subject”.', ""Arpita Adhya is a music journalist and self-titled K-pop superfan. She believes the use of AI in the industry is demonstrative of the pressure artists are under to create new content.“Most recording artists will put out an album every two years, but K-pop groups are pushing out albums every six to eight months, because there’s so much hype around them.”She also believes AI has been normalised in the industry, with the introduction of AI covers which have exploded on YouTube. The cover tracks are created by fans and use technology to mimic another artist's voice.It's this kind of trend that Arpita would like to see regulated, something western artists are calling for too."", 'Just last month megastars including Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj wrote an open letter calling for the ""predatory"" use of AI in the music industry to be stopped.They called on tech firms to pledge not to develop AI music-generation tools ""that undermine or replace the human artistry of songwriters and artists, or deny us fair compensation for our work"".For Arpita, a lack of regulations means fans feel an obligation to regulate what is and isn’t OK.“Whilst there are no clear guidelines on how much artists can and can’t use AI, we have the struggle of making boundaries ourselves, and always asking ‘what is right and wrong?’”Thankfully she feels K-pop artists are aware of public opinion and hopes there will be change.“The fans are the biggest part and they have a lot of influence over artists. Groups are always keen to learn and listen, and if Seventeen and Aespa realise they are hurting their fans, they will hopefully address that.”Update 14 July 2024: This article was amended to confirm that while AI is being experimented with in K-pop, it was not used to write songs for the latest Seventeen album.']"
'Protectionism eroding global business' - world trade chief,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce93n7lgw5qo#2,The boss of the World Trade Organization warns the global economy is facing numerous challenges.,"Sun, 07 Jul 2024 23:13:17 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264653,"['Global trade “is not having the best of times at the moment”.That is the admission of the director general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. “We are seeing increasing protectionism, some undermining of the WTO rules, and some of this is leading to fragmentation,” she tells the BBC.“Global trade is really part of the lifeblood for making countries resilient - and also for underpinning growth, so we are concerned about that.”In recent weeks and months these fragmentations have come to the fore with the EU imposing provisional tariffs of up to 37.4% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). It followed after the US in May introduced 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs.Both Brussels and Washington accuse the Chinese government of unfairly subsidising its EV sector, allowing producers to export cars at unfairly low prices, and threatening jobs in the West.President Biden has also increased import taxes on a range of other Chinese products that he said formed ""the industries of the future"". These include EV batteries and the minerals they contain, the cells needed to make solar panels, and computer chips.Meanwhile, the US has been pouring billions of dollars of government money into green technology, through its Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce a reliance on Chinese imports.', 'EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis tells the BBC that Europe does not want to close the market for EVs. “We welcome imports, we welcome competition, but this competition must be fair,” he says.Last year, the volume of global trade fell for just the third time in 30 years, according to the WTO. It says the 1.2% decline was linked to higher inflation and interest rates, and is forecasting a recovery this year.However those factors have their roots in events that are continuing to fundamentally reshape the global economy,  the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath explained in a recent speech.“What we\'ve seen in the last few years, I would say, especially when it comes to global trade relations, is nothing like we\'ve seen since the end of the Cold War."" “The last few years, you\'ve had numerous shocks, including the pandemic. We had Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, and following these events, increasingly, countries around the world are guided by economic security, and national security concerns, in determining who they trade with and who they invest in,” she said.That’s affecting countries as far apart as Peru, Ghana and Vietnam as they increasingly find themselves having to choose between strengthening economic ties with the western powers, or a China-Russia axis.“We\'re also concerned about the emerging fragmentation that we see in the trade data,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. “We\'re seeing that trade between like-minded blocks is growing faster than trade across such blocks.”She warns that “it will be costly for the world” to continue down this path. WTO research has estimated that price at 5% of the global economy, whilst the IMF has suggested it could be nearer to 7% or $7.4tn (£5.8tn) of lost output in the long run.', ""The EU’s introduction of tariffs on Chinese-made EVs follows a surge in their exports to Europe over the last few years. Exports jumped from $1.6bn in value in 2020 to $11.5bn last year, according to one study, which said they now made up 37% of all EV imports into the EU.BYD, Geely and SAIC are some of the Chinese EV makers said to have benefitted from billions of dollars worth of government help.After many years of support Chinese EV companies no longer need that help, says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “They are today simply very competitive on their own terms. I think the introduction of tariffs is a symptom that something is out of balance.”When it comes to broader relationship, Mr Eskelund says it’s “mind boggling” that since 2017 the volume of goods that the EU has sold to China has fallen about a third, even though China’s economy has been growing steadily.Citing Chinese restrictions around market access for overseas firms, and tough security regulations, he adds: “I think it's fair to say that that Europe still remains a significantly more open market to Chinese companies, then the other way around. And that is obviously something that needs to change.”The chamber’s recent survey showed that members have the lowest confidence on record for investing in China."", ""It comes as the EU is trying to lower its economic dependence on China. European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen last year described the need to “de-risk not de-couple” its relations with China.Brussels' concerns include Beijing using sensitive technology for military purposes, and its support for Russia as it continues its offensive in Ukraine.Companies including Ikea, Nike and Apple are also trying to become less reliant on China.Whilst the EU and China are set to hold talks about the potential EV tariffs, Chinese state media has reported that retaliatory measures are being considered on EU goods including pork, cognac and luxury cars."", 'However, there are other barriers for global trade to overcome, including in two of the most important arteries for moving goods around the world.This year Panama Canal officials had to reduce the number of ships allowed to traverse the waterway. This is due to a lack of rainfall to fill the lake that feeds the canal.Meanwhile, the Suez Canal is effectively cut off because of ongoing attacks on commercial ships by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. Traffic through the canal is down 90%, according to logistics firm Kuehne+Nagel.Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of the German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd, says this disruption means that the rates his firm charges are up between 30% and 40%.Whilst shipping costs are a small part of retail prices, Mr Habben Jansen says “these extra costs in the end get passed on” to consumers. That could end up pushing inflation up just as central banks are showing signs of getting it under control.That would be “detrimental to consumers,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala.Despite all the tensions, she says trade has shown signs of resilience, and she adds that her organization can help countries solve their differences.Meanwhile, Dr Okonjo-Iweala admits that some WTO rules will need to change to help meet the challenge of climate change.  “I strongly believe that some of our [global trade] rules, we do need to look at them,"" she says.“When they were put in place, decades ago, we were not confronting the kind of climate change threats we confront today.”Regarding the increased use of tariffs, she adds: “We hope we don\'t have a repeat of what we saw in the 1930s. We had retaliatory tariffs, and it was downhill from there and everyone lost.“So I do hope we will not enter into that kind of era again”.', '']"
Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kk4lxe702o#2,A Texas start-up is developing cargo gliders that would be towed behind a jet.,"Thu, 04 Jul 2024 23:05:00 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264769,"['US start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing.Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them.At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo.Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft.Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft.Their latest test aircraft is known as the “flying piano” because of its poor gliding characteristics. Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes.Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line.They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.', ""Aerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel.One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously.The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft’s engines.In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls “a combination of gliding and surfing”.The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic.Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350’s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn."", 'Mr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years’ experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi and Doron Appelboim, veterans of Amazon’s drone delivery project, on the basis that “there has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft"". The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations.For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population.Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by.', 'Mr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project. “We’ve engaged outside advisors to be devil’s advocates,"" he adds.He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery. On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots.James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something.“It stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.”However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely.“It should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.”', 'Regulators are likely to be cautious as well, particularly in the US, where the Federal Aviation Authority is under pressure after serious problems with Boeing aircraft.Mr Graetz replies that his team has complied with every request from the FAA so far. “The FAA has always been super risk averse. That’s their business!”Fred Lopez spent 36 years in aviation operations at cargo giant UPS. As he says, he’s put  “my entire adult life” into working out the most cost-effective way to operate an air freight business.Mr Lopez admits he was profoundly sceptical about cargo gliders when Aerolane first approached him. But the prospect of serious fuel savings won him over and now he sits on their advisory board.Cutting fuel costs is an obsession in civil aviation. When the upturned wing-tips we see out of a cabin window became a standard design feature airlines cut fuel costs by around 5%.But gliders only consume the fuel required by their tow plane. If that too is a cargo aircraft, a pair of gliders drawn by one jet represents a significant reduction in fuel consumption on a large shipment.The initial Aerolane design uses their autopilot plus what Mr Lopez terms a human “safety pilot”. This should make certification from the FAA easier.“Aerolane is not trying to change everything at one go” he says.Their ultimate goal is autonomous operation using AI, or as Mr Lopez puts it “to pull the pilot out of the seat"".And, if the flying piano can surf, then who knows what\'s possible?']"
Would having an AI boss be better than your current human one?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c03lgz2zrg1o#2,Companies are now experimenting with using AI systems to manage their staff.,"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 23:09:47 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264894,"[""With the stress of managing 83 employees taking its toll, Hannu Rauma was feeling discouraged and frustrated.“I was getting too bogged down in all these things that were going wrong amongst the teams, and feeling this disappointment,” says Mr Rauma, who is based in Vancouver, Canada.He is a senior manager at a company called Student Marketing Agency, which employs university students to provide marketing support for small businesses.“When I was bringing new clients on board, half of my mind would be saying, ‘we're going to screw up’, and it would dampen my enthusiasm.”"", ""But Mr Rauma says that all changed from last November, when the firm began using an autonomous AI manager developed by US-based company Inspira.The AI manager helps the agency’s employees, who work flexible hours remotely, to set their schedules and plan their workloads in advance.It checks their timekeeping, sends them deadline reminders and regular check-in messages, and records the time spent on different clients, so the latter can be billed accurately. The AI also makes suggestions to improve the wording of written text, is available to answer work-related questions, and automatically updates everyone’s work progress in a central portal.Mr Rauma says that the shift towards an AI manager has not only reduced his stress levels, but has enabled his employees to work faster and be more productive. “I'm able to focus on the growth of the company and all the positive things. It's added years to my life, I'm sure,” he says.Mr Rauma adds that his relationships with his employees have also improved drastically. “Before, it felt a lot like a father-child situation. Now, we're more on an equal footing. Before, it was only about solving problems. But now we’re able to have more light-hearted discussions.”"", 'But not everyone at Student Marketing Agency is using the AI manager yet. Mr Rauma and 26 of his 83 employees were actually part of a study run by Inspira and academics from Columbia University, Arizona State University, and the University of Wisconsin to compare the performance of the AI manager with its human counterparts.Participants were divided into three groups: one coached by a human manager, another by the AI manager, and the last group by both AI and human manager.The AI manager achieved a 44% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays in advance, and was able to motivate the employees to log in on time 42% of the time. These figures were comparable to the human manager, who achieved scores of 45% and 44% for those two areas.Yet when the AI manager worked in partnership with a human manager, together they achieved a 72% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays, and managed to achieve 46% on-time success.Despite the study being statistically small, and concentrated on a specific type of worker and field, its results point to interesting implications for companies introducing AI tools.', ""While businesses like UPS, Dell and others have announced significant job cuts this year, with the intention of replacing many roles with AI, Prof Paul Thurman, from Columbia University in New York, argues that swapping management roles completely for AI would be a mistake.“The middle management layer is the most critical layer in any organisation,” says the professor of management. “They're the layer that, if it starts turning over, you're in for a wild ride. Your people don't see continuity, they don't get mentoring and coaching… all the human things that human managers are better at than AI and should be focusing on.”AI, Prof Thurman adds, can liberate managers from endless reminding and checking in, to focus on more innovative ways of working. For example, managers can cherry pick project teams based on individual skillsets, oversee the brief, then hand over to their AI to manage minutiae like deadlines.AI can also identify who in the team is falling behind and may need to be managed more closely by a human, and by the same token, hone in on star performers who require extra recognition.But companies should steer away from AI managers becoming a surveillance tool, he says.“You don’t want to get to a point where you are noting that, not only do people not clock in on time, but they take too much time at lunch, and they're not eating enough salad. You don't want to go that far,” says Prof Thurman. “You want to find the right way to encourage the right behaviours.”"", ""AI managers can also help people who have become “accidental managers” - people who excel in their roles and end up managing people as a result, despite management not being a natural skill for them, says Tina Rahman, founder of London-based HR consultancy, HR Habitat.“We did a study which looked at the reasons people leave a job. Almost 100% of the respondents said it was because of bad management.“Some of them said they didn’t like the way they'd been managed, and most of them also said it was because they didn’t know what was expected of them or if they were doing a good job,” says Ms Rahman.“You'd assume that an AI manager would be built to give those correct instructions, to give complete transparency on the requirements, and the outcomes. People are likely to be more productive when they know what's expected of them.”But an over-reliance on AI management sets the tone that companies only care about output and not people, Ms Rahman warns.“It’s going to be very hard for a business to tell their employees that they’re introducing this brand new AI system that's going to completely manage them, then say, with the same face, that ‘we care about your experiences in the workplace,’” she says."", ""Yet perhaps the biggest concern about AI managers is not from a people perspective, but from a cybersecurity one, warns James Bore, managing director of cybersecurity consultancy, Bores, and speaker and author.“If you have an AI manager, and you've given them all of the company's processes, procedures, and intellectual property that is suddenly all in the software, it can be kidnapped by someone who wants to clone it, and it could also be held to ransom,” says Mr Bore.“If you've come to rely on it, which companies will when they start replacing humans with AI, you're kind of stuck, because you've got no resilience, no option to switch back to the humans, because you don't have them anymore.”Rather than companies becoming more efficient through an extensive use of AI, Mr Bore says there could be an unintended consequence beyond becoming dependent on systems that could fail.“The more you automate, and the more you remove people from your business, yes, you'll bring down costs. But you will also make your company more replaceable.”""]"
How Microsoft and Nvidia bet correctly to leapfrog Apple,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nglq80w7eo#2,The two tech firms were among the first to see the commercial potential of AI.,"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 23:05:03 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265013,"['Life comes at you fast.Last month, AI chip giant Nvidia briefly became the world’s richest company, overtaking Microsoft, which had in turn risen above Apple.When this news was mentioned on stage at a tech industry event I attended in Copenhagen, there was spontaneous applause from the audience.As I write, Nvidia is now back in second place, after a fall in its share price took its combined value down to $3tn (£2.4tn) compared with $3.4tn for Microsoft.Two things have propelled these two US tech titans to such a dizzying pinnacle: AI and foresight.Microsoft started investing in OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019. Meanwhile, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang pushed his company towards AI chip development many years before generative AI exploded onto the scene.Both firms took a long-term bet on the current AI boom – and so far, it’s paid off, leaving former top-dog Apple trailing in their wake. But how long will it last?', 'This year’s London Tech Week, an annual event for the UK tech scene, may as well have been called London AI Week. The letters AI were emblazoned on every stand, and uttered in every speech.I bumped into Anne Boden, the founder of Starling Bank, a significant fintech disruptor. She was buzzing with excitement.“We thought we knew who the winners and losers were [in tech],” she told me. “But with AI, we are throwing the dice again”.She believes she’s watching the AI revolution re-landscape the tech sector, and she wants to dive back in.That same week I also popped along to Founders Forum, an annual gathering of around 250 high-level entrepreneurs and investors. Some serious money, in other words. It’s a confidential event, but I don’t think I’ll get into too much trouble for saying that much of the chat there was also centred around AI.A few days after that, a headline in the Financial Times caught my eye. “Most stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,” it read, claiming that more than half of the stocks in Citigroup’s “AI winners basket” had fallen in value in 2024.Life comes at you fast indeed.', '“Given how high valuations have leapt for tech companies, missteps ahead could cause big wobbles in share prices,” warns Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.“Just like the dot.com bubble, over-enthusiasm risks spilling over into disappointment.”In 2023 you’d have been forgiven for thinking that anything with the acronym AI in it was guaranteed to open up a lucrative seam of funding, with investment dollars flooding into all things AI.My friend Saurabh Dayal, who is based in Scotland, identifies AI projects for his pharmaceutical firm to potentially collaborate on. He said he soon grew tired of misleading pitches.“I spend a lot of time saying ‘… but that’s not AI’,” he tells me.It seems both investors and clients are finally growing wiser to the term AI, and, as a result, more picky.', 'Speaking to the FT, Citi’s Stuart Kaiser said that while AI remained a big theme in the world of stocks and shares, “just saying AI 15 times isn’t going to cut it anymore”.In addition, there is increased awareness of current generative AI products not exactly living up to their own hype. Inaccuracies, misinformation, displays of bias, copyright infringements and some content that’s just plain weird.And early AI-enabled physical devices like the Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin have received bad reviews.“We’re seeing the market around generative AI mature a little right now – early experiments set a lot of grand expectations, but when the rubber hit the road there were too many unexpected outcomes,” says Chris Weston, chief digital and information officer of the tech service firm Jumar.“Businesses have a lot of value tied up in goodwill – the trust and comfort that their clients have in their services. Introducing ungovernable chatbots is a step too far for many right now.”Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore agrees that the pressure is on for AI firms to deliver on their promises. “The bubble will burst the moment one of the giants fails to show any meaningful growth from AI,” he says.But he does not believe that is going to happen any time soon.“Everyone is still jostling for position, and all companies are pinning their strategies on AI,” he adds.“All the players are ramping up their activities, increasing spend and claiming early successes.”', ""There’s another reason why the AI bubble might pop. It’s got nothing to do with the quality of the products or their market value. It’s whether the planet itself can afford it.A study published last year predicted that the AI industry could consume the same amount of energy of a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027 if growth continues at its current rate.I interviewed Prof Kate Crawford from the University of Southern California for the BBC’s Tech Life podcast, and she told me that worrying about the amount of electricity, energy and water required to power AI kept her awake at night. Dr Sasha Luccioni from the machine-learning firm Hugging Face is also concerned.“There’s simply not enough renewable energy to power AI right now – most of that bubble is fuelled by oil and gas,” she says.The hope is that the tech could be used to identify sustainability solutions, like for example the secret of nuclear fusion, the way in which the sun gets its energy. But that hasn’t happened yet, and in the meantime, “AI systems put a huge strain on energy grids that are already under immense strain,” adds Dr Luccioni.With so much uncertainty, few should bet against another shake-up among the world's richest firms. But currently, Apple has a fight on its hands to catch up with Microsoft and Nvidia in the AI race.""]"
The fastest data in the world,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clkkllxm4jzo#2,Researchers are seeing how fast data can be delivered amid rising demand for bandwidth.,"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 23:02:51 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265128,"['As IT updates go, this was about as nerve-wracking as things can get.In February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) – the world’s biggest science experiment – two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button.Suddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. “There was high-fiving involved,” recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. “It was super-cool to see.”He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands.A data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) – or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists’ access to the results of LHC experiments.A subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable.“This transponder that Nokia uses, it’s like a celebrity,” says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. “We had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.”This amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still – they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.', 'In labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection.This is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster.The duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. “Due to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,” explains Mr Opdenakker.Every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data – about one petabyte per second. That’s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs.This is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today.“The upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,” says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.', 'A time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That’s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work.In this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors.He also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores – a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people’s home to the internet.', 'But older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That’s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection.“I think it’s a world best, we don’t know of any results that are better than that,” says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line.For this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself.Activities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030.But reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications. “For remote robotic surgery across 3,000 miles… you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down,” says Mr Creaner.Dr Okonkwo adds that training AI will increasingly require moving huge datasets around. The faster this can be done, the better, he argues.And Ian Phillips, who works alongside Prof Forysiak, says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available: “Humanity finds a way of consuming it.”', 'Although multiple petabits per second is far beyond what today’s web users need, Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm, says it is striking how quickly demand for bandwidth is growing – currently, at around 30% year-on-year on transatlantic fibre optic cables.Content provision – social media, cloud services, video streaming – is eating up far more bandwidth than before, she notes: “It used to be like 15% of international bandwidth in the early 2010’s. Now it’s up to three quarters, 75%. It’s absolutely massive.”In the UK, there is still a long way to go to improve internet speeds. Many people cannot access sufficiently fast broadband at home.Andrew Kernahan, head of public affairs at the Internet Service Providers Association says most home users can now access gigabit per second speeds.However, only about a third of broadband customers are signing up for such technology. There’s no “killer app” at the moment that really requires it, says Mr Kernahan. This might change as more and more TV is consumed via the internet, for example.“There’s definitely a challenge to get the message out there and make people more aware of what they can do with the infrastructure,” he says.']"

You then get automatically billed.However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.', 'Amazon was quick to claim that the reports were “erroneous”, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops.Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that “this is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common”.Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question – whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed “AI washing” in reference to the environmental ""green washing"".', 'But first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information.The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called ""generative AI"". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images.Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google\'s Gemini, and Microsoft\'s Copilot are popular examples of generative AI.When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they\'re actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not.Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software.While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year.And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities.""Some founders seem to believe that if they don’t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,"" says Mr Ayangar.""And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.""', 'It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from  another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as ""AI start-ups"" in fact used virtually no AI at all.""The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,"" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures.He explains that ""cutting-edge AI capabilities"" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.', 'Douglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI.""If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,” he says. “The term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge.""AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve.""Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies.And, says Mr Ayangar: ""If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.""', 'Regulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI.""The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,"" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.', 'In the UK, rules and laws covering AI washing are already in place, including the Advertising Standards Authority\'s (ASA\'s) code of conduct, which states that marketing communications must not materially mislead, or be likely to do so.Michael Cordeaux, associate in the regulatory team at UK corporate law firm Walker Morris, says that AI claims have become an increasingly common feature of advertisements subject to ASA investigation.Examples include a paid-for Instagram post about an app captioned ""Enhance your Photos with AI"", which was held by the ASA to be exaggerating the performance of the app, and was therefore misleading.""What is clear is that AI claims are becoming increasingly prevalent and, presumably, effective at piquing consumer interest,"" says Mr Cordeaux.“In my opinion we are at the peak of the AI hype cycle,” says Sandra Wachter, a professor of technology and regulation at Oxford University, and a leading global expert on AI.“However, I feel that we have forgotten to ask if it always makes sense to use AI for all types of tasks. I remember seeing advertisements in the London Tube for electric toothbrushes that are powered by AI. Who is this for? Who is helped by this?""Also, the environmental impact of AI is often glossed over, she says.“AI does not grow on trees… the technology already contributes more to climate change than aviation. We have to move away from this one-sided overhyped discussion, and really think about specific tasks and sectors that AI can be beneficial for, and not just blindly implement it into everything.”But in the longer term, says Advika Jalan, head of research at MMC Ventures, the problem of AI washing may subside on its own.""AI is becoming so ubiquitous - even if they’re just ChatGPT wrappers - that \'AI-powered\' as a branding tool will likely cease to be a differentiator after some time,"" she says. ""It will be a bit like saying \'we’re on the internet\'.""']"
The screen tech that can do almost anything,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nn6z6z4ypo#2,New technology promises TV and phone screens that use much less electricity than current models.,"Mon, 24 Jun 2024 23:02:12 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265376,"['At first glance, it looks like a relic from the 1980s. A tiny computer screen with flickering, low-resolution text scrolling across it. But this could be the future.The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology. It is radically different to the LED technology used in your smartphone display today, and it could lead to devices that are thinner, cheaper and have longer battery life.Not only that, PeLEDs are very unusual in that they can absorb light as well as emit it, meaning you can use the same material to integrate touch, fingerprint and ambient light-sensing capabilities, says Feng Gao at Linköping University in Sweden.“This is difficult but we think it’s possible.""In today’s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone’s screen itself. In a paper published in April, Prof Gao and colleagues demonstrated their prototype with touch and ambient light sensitivity already working.“It’s a very nice demonstration… it’s very new,” says Daniele Braga, head of sales and marketing for Fluxim, a technology research firm in Switzerland. Though he notes that optimising all the different functions promised here might make it difficult to commercialise this kind of display quickly.Via video call, Prof Gao shows off the latest version of the technology. It is another small screen, but this time the pixels per inch (ppi), a measurement of the sharpness of the display, has been nearly doubled – at 90 ppi.On the screen, a simple animation plays, showing two stick figures fighting. A paper with further details about this prototype has just been published.', 'Perovskite the mineral contains calcium, titanium and oxygen arranged in a crystal structure. It was discovered in the 1800s, but people later realised that they could make other kinds of perovskites that shared the same structure while having different elements or molecules as the components.Depending on the materials chosen, perovskites can be really good at, for example, conducting electricity or emitting light.“By slightly tuning the chemical composition you can cover the full visible spectrum,” says Dr Braga, explaining that making perovskites is a relatively simple and cheap process. “If you think about mass production, this is gigantic.”There are some problems, though. PeLEDs are notoriously unstable – they go bad with exposure to moisture or oxygen, for instance. Loreta Muscarella at VU Amsterdam, a university, is working to develop new kinds of PeLEDs.She says that if you leave a PeLED lying around for a few hours or days, the colour of light it emits will gradually degrade or shift to a less pure version of, say, green, than the green you want.And this undermines the whole point of perovskites. They are desirable in part because they can be tuned to emit a very specific, very pure form of red, green or blue – the key hues required for full colour digital displays.', 'To keep them stable, PeLEDs can be encapsulated in glue or resin, says Prof Gao. But researchers are still working on ensuring that the technology does not falter over a long period.Dr Muscarella says that traditional LEDs have lifetimes of 50,000 hours or more whereas PeLED lifespans are still in the hundreds to thousands of hours range.It could be years before you buy a commercial product that contains a PeLED, she adds.But there’s a different type of light-emitting perovskite that you might see on the market first.It relies on photoluminescence. This isn’t an LED as such but rather a filter or film-like material that absorbs and re-emits light in a particular colour.In some TV’s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen.It’s by mixing those colours at different levels that you can get the range of hues required to display a full picture.The red, green and blue filters are lit up by an LED backlight. But today’s filters actually block a lot of that light.Photoluminescent perovskites, in contrast, let almost all the light through, which would mean a big increase in brightness and efficiency.Helio, a British company, is working on this. A video on their website shows how a red or green coloured perovskite film can re-emit blue light as either red or green almost perfectly.', 'The technology Prof Gao and his colleagues are developing is quite different. They are experimenting with screens that emit light using LEDs which are themselves made with perovskites.These are known as electroluminescent perovskites. Working with them is tricky because they are sensitive to electrical fields and, as mentioned, aren’t very stable. But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all.The main advantages of switching to this technology could be in lowering the cost of these devices and in reducing their energy consumption.No-one is quite sure how much less energy a future PeLED display might consume versus, say, an OLED screen, but lab experiments suggest that PeLEDs are already competitive with OLEDs and could one day significantly exceed them in terms of efficiency, says Dr Muscarella.', 'Prof Sir Richard Friend, at the University of Cambridge, is one of the co-founders of Helio, along with Prof Henry Snaith at the University of Oxford. He points out that one of the challenges with PeLEDs is in getting them to emit light in the right direction. This really matters for displays.“You need to get light emitted in the forward direction rather than getting stuck going sideways,” he explains.Researchers are experimenting with many different techniques to address this problem. Dr Muscarella and colleagues have tried imprinting a bumpy nanoscale pattern on the surface of PeLEDs, for example, which appears to improve light emission.For Prof Gao, however, who has published alongside Prof Sir Friend and who received his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 2011, the promise of PeLED screens that do so much more than emit light is beckoning.From fingerprint verification to heart-rate sensing and light detection, it could all one day be done using single slab of layered materials with the all-important light-absorbing perovskite in the middle.“It’s really very unique,” he says, enthusing. “This is not possible with other LED technologies.”']"
Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyrr3mm8evyo#2,Funding concerns are expected to see Saudi Arabia reduce its giant building schemes.,"Sun, 23 Jun 2024 23:03:08 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265490,"['“They can keep saying that, and we can keep proving them wrong.”That was the response of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a TV documentary broadcast in July 2023, while talking about scepticism surrounding Saudi Arabia’s flagship construction projects.Almost a year later, some of the doubts are turning out to be true.In recent months, Saudi Arabia has seemingly scaled back plans for its vast desert development project Neom, which is the centrepiece of Vision 2030.This is the economic diversification programme spearheaded by Prince Mohammed, the Gulf state’s de-facto ruler, to transition the country’s economy away from oil-dependency.As well as Neom, Saudi Arabia is also developing 13 other large construction schemes, or “giga projects” as they are referred, worth trillions of dollars. These include an entertainment city on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh, multiple luxury island resorts on the Red Sea, and a cluster of other tourist and cultural destinations.', 'But low oil prices have impacted government revenues, forcing Riyadh to reassess these projects, and explore new funding strategies.An advisor, who is associated with the government but wished not to be named, tells the BBC that the projects are being reviewed, with a decision expected soon.“The decision will be based on multiple factors,” he says. “But there is no doubt that there will be a recalibration. Some projects will proceed as planned, but some might get delayed or scaled down.”Announced in 2017, Neom is a $500bn (£394bn) plan to build 10 futuristic cities in a desert region in the north west of the country.The most ambitious of them, and the one that has gained all the headlines, is The Line. This will be a linear city consisting of two adjoined, parallel skyscraper walls standing 500m high - taller than the Empire State Building. Yet they will have combined width of just 200m, including the gap between them.', ""The original plan was that they would extend for 170km (105 miles), and become home to nine million inhabitants.But according to people familiar with the details – and as already leaked to the press - the project developers will now focus on completing just 2.4km by 2030, as part of the first module.When The Line was first announced it was billed as a “carbon-free linear city” that would redefine urban living, with amenities for residents like parks, waterfalls, flying taxis, and robot maids.The city would have no roads or cars, and would be made up of interconnected, pedestrianised communities. It would also include an ultra-high-speed train, with a maximum journey duration of 20 minutes anywhere within city limits.How many of these features will be part of the first phase are unclear.Along with The Line, Neom is also due to include an octagon-shaped floating industrial city, and a mountain ski-resort that will host the Asian Winter Games in 2029.Ali Shihabi, a former banker now on Neom's advisory board, says the targets set for projects under Vision 2030 were deliberately “designed to be over ambitious”.“It was meant to be over ambitious, with the clear understanding that only a part of it would be delivered on time. But even that part would be significant,” says Mr Shihabi."", 'The scaling back of Neom has put the spotlight on the funding challenges that the Saudi government is facing.Neom is being paid for by the Saudi government through its sovereign wealth entity, the Public Investment Fund (PIF).The official cost to build Neom, $500bn, is 50% more than the country’s entire federal budget for the year. But analysts estimate that it would ultimately cost more than $2tn to execute the full project.Saudi Arabia’s government budget has been in a deficit since late 2022, when the world’s largest oil exporter began slashing production to accelerate global prices. The government has forecast a deficit of $21bn for this year.The PIF is feeling the pinch. It controls assets of about $900bn, but it had just $15bn in cash reserves as of September.', 'Tim Callen, the former IMF chief to Saudi Arabia and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, says that raising capital for Neom and other large-scale projects is a key challenge in the future.“It is going to be increasingly challenging to fund the PIF to the levels that are required for these projects,” Mr Callen says.The Gulf state is tapping other avenues to shore up capital.Earlier this month, it sold roughly $11.2bn worth of shares in its national oil company Saudi Aramco. Most of those proceeds are expected to go to the PIF, which was also the biggest beneficiary when the company went public in 2019.The sale comes amid volatility in oil prices. In July of last year, in an attempt to bolster prices, the Saudi Arabia-led OPEC+ oil producing group of countries curbed production.Riyadh voluntarily cut its supplies by one million barrels a day. However, this month, OPEC+ reversed the decision, and it will gradually start increasing production from October.', 'According to the International Monetary Fund, the price of a barrel of oil needs to be $96.20 for Saudi Arabia to be able to balance its budget. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for crude, has been hovering around $80 a barrel.The country has also relied on selling government bonds to maintain funding flows for the PIF. The other challenge has been that foreign direct investment has remained far below targets, underlining Riyadh’s struggle to attract funding from private companies and international investors.‘It’s going to be very difficult to persuade investors to come into projects that they view as being overly ambitious,” says Mr Callen. “It’s unclear where your returns will ultimately come from.”The Gulf state is also funnelling money into sectors such as tourism, mining, entertainment, and sports as part of the economic diversification strategy.In recent years, Saudi Arabia has won the hosting rights for several major international events, such as the football Asian Cup in 2027, Asian Winter Games in 2029, and the World Expo 2030. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for the 2034 FIFA Men’s World Cup. All these projects will require massive investments in the years to come.', 'Mr Shihabi expects the government to prioritise these international events as they get closer. “Projects where we have specific deadlines to meet will get prioritized by the nature of things,” he says.In April, at a special meeting of the World Economic Forum meeting held in Riyadh, the country’s Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said the government didn’t have an “ego”, and would adjust its Vision 2030 plan to transform its economy as needed.“We will change course, we will extend some of the projects, we will downscale some projects, we will accelerate some projects,” he said.', '']"
How mobile phone networks are embracing AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6pp1nvw5zwo#2,Providers are increasing using artificial intelligence to maintain a reliable service.,"Wed, 19 Jun 2024 23:02:43 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265603,"['Our mobile phones are getting a whole lot smarter, but what about the telecoms networks they run on?Last week, Apple became the latest mobile phone firm to announce that it will be adding artificial intelligence (AI) to its handsets’ operating system.Called Apple Intelligence, and also due to be incorporated into the phones’ Siri chatbot, it aims to make them easier and quicker to use. And turn Siri into even more of a personal assistant.It follows after Samsung’s Galaxy AI, and Google’s Gemini AI for its own Pixel handsets.This increased of use AI means phones will be doing a lot more computing, and that means they’ll produce and use a lot more data. This is going to put more strain on the mobile phone networks, such as the UK’s O2, EE, Vodafone and Three.', 'To help them cope, telecoms firms such as these are also increasingly introducing AI, says Ian Fogg, director of network innovation at research consultancy CCS Insight.“Network operators are using AI to manage the radio frequencies dynamically, to provide an optimum level of service. And to manage cell towers, for example, so they use less energy at times of lower demand.""Such increased use of AI to look after mobile phone networks is now very much global. In South Korea, Korea Telecom is now able to localise and fix faults within a minute, thanks to AI-enabled network monitoring, says Alex Sinclair, chief technology officer of the GSMA, the body representing global mobile operators.Meanwhile, AT&T in the US is using predictive, AI algorithms schooled on trillions of previous network alerts to warn it when things are about to go wrong.', 'Other operators, like Vodafone, are using AI digital twins - virtual digital replicas of real-world equipment, such as masts and antennas – to constantly monitor how their networks are performing.And AI is also being used to manage how increasingly massive data centres use energy to keep their servers cool and optimise storage capacity.The explosion in data created by the increased use of AI is another reason why telecoms firms around the world are continuing to invest in so-called 5G Standalone mobile networks. These use new, dedicated 5G infrastructure rather than relying in part on upgrading the older, less efficient 4G system.5G Standalone offers much higher speeds and capacity. But some experts believe that even this higher-spec technology won’t be sufficient to cope with the demands of the AI era.At this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, for example, some experts argued that AI won’t be able to reach its full potential until the roll out of 6G from 2028.', 'While mobile customers only tend to notice the network when things go wrong, they are much more aware when customer service levels are poor, with all the reputational damage this can cause brands.So the industry is also hoping AI can radically improve the way they interact with and serve customers.For example, the Global Telco AI Alliance - a joint venture company made up of Deutsche Telekom, e&, Singtel, Softbank and SK Telecom with 1.3 billion customers across 50 countries – aims to develop an AI chatbot specifically tailored to the telecoms sector, and the type of questions customers typically ask.This specially trained chatbot will be able to deal with most of the basic queries coming from customers, leaving call centre staff free to concentrate on more complex cases, the Alliance’s founders hope.', 'Meanwhile, Vodafone has teamed up with Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to improve its customer service, spearheaded by its digital assistant Tobi, which interacts with more than 40 million customers a month in 13 countries and across 15 languages.The more Tobi can answer customer queries without the need for human intervention, the fewer complaints there are likely to be, which is good for profits and corporate reputation.“We see AI primarily as a ‘virtual assistant’ for humans,” says Scott Petty, Vodafone’s chief technology officer. “We already see AI freeing-up Vodafone employees’ time from tedious, repetitive manual work, enabling them to focus on more creative activities that benefit our customers and the environment.”AI also leaves the customer agents freer to work on more complex cases, he argues. Vodafone also says that Azure OpenAI is helping customers more easily find what they’re looking for on its websites, with early evidence showing a doubling in the number of successful completed online customer journeys, and a 10% reduction in follow-up calls.', 'While many commentators worry that AI could lead to massive job losses in the telco sector, as menial tasks are increasingly automated by software, GSMA’s Mr Sinclair believes it could actually be empowering, particularly for lower-income countries.“AI will give emerging markets a specialist tool to help them catch up,” he argues. “We’re in favour of trying to democratise AI so that it’s not just the wealthy who can use it.”He believes that some of the doom-mongering around AI has been overdone, and so he strikes a more optimistic tone.It’s a view shared by CCS Insight’s Ian Fogg: “AI has been around for some years, used for specific [telecoms] cases. But now it’s being applied in many more areas - network, devices, software - such that every tool we use now has the potential to become much, much better.“AI has the potential to make networks greener, and the world a more efficient place.”']"
Could brain-like computers be a 'competition killer'?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx99qv2w1ddo#2,Computers built like brains could be much more energy efficient than current designs.,"Mon, 17 Jun 2024 23:24:11 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265721,"[""Modern computing's appetite for electricity is increasing at an alarming rate.By 2026 consumption by data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency could be as much as double 2022 levels, according to a recent report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).It estimates that in 2026 energy consumption by those three sectors could be roughly equivalent to Japan's annual energy needs.Companies like Nvidia - whose computer chips underpin most AI applications today - are working on developing more energy efficient hardware.But could an alternative path be to build computers with a fundamentally different type of architecture, one that is more energy efficient?Some firms certainly think so, and are drawing on the structure and function of an organ which uses a fraction of the power of a conventional computer to perform more operations faster: the brain."", ""In neuromorphic computing, electronic devices imitate neurons and synapses, and are interconnected in a way that resembles the electrical network of the brain.It isn't new - researchers have been working on the technique since the 1980s.But the energy requirements of the AI revolution are increasing the pressure to get the nascent technology into the real world.Current systems and platforms exist primarily as research tools, but proponents say they could provide huge gains in energy efficiency, Amongst those with commercial ambitions include hardware giants like Intel and IBM.A handful of small companies are also on the scene. “The opportunity is there waiting for the company that can figure this out,” says Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights. “[And] the opportunity is such that it could be an Nvidia killer”."", 'In May SpiNNcloud Systems, a spinout of the Dresden University of Technology, announced it will begin selling neuromorphic supercomputers for the first time, and is taking pre-orders.“We have reached the commercialisation of neuromorphic supercomputers in front of other companies,” says Hector Gonzalez, its co-chief executive.It is a significant development says Tony Kenyon, a professor of nanoelectronic and nanophotonic materials at University College London who works in the field.“While there still isn’t a killer app… there are lots of areas where neuromorphic computing will provide significant gains in energy efficiency and performance, and I’m sure we’ll start to see wide adoption of the technology as it matures,” he says.', 'Neuromorphic computing covers a range of approaches - from simply a more brain-inspired approach, to a near-total simulation of the human brain (which we are really nowhere near).But there are some basic design properties that set it apart from conventional computing.First, unlike conventional computers, neuromorphic computers don’t have separate memory and processing units. Instead, those tasks are performed together on one chip in a single location.Removing that need to transfer data between the two reduces the energy used and speeds up processing time, notes Prof Kenyon.Also common can be an event-driven approach to computing.In contrast to conventional computing where every part of the system is always on and available to communicate with any other part all the time, activation in neuromorphic computing can be sparser.The imitation neurons and synapses only activate in a moment of time when they have something to communicate, much the same way plenty of neurons and synapses in our brains only spring into action where there is a reason.Doing work only when there is something to process also saves power.And while modern computers are digital – using 1s or 0s to represent data -  a neuromorphic computing can be analogue. Historically important, that method of computing relies on continuous signals and can be useful where data coming from the outside world needs to be analysed.However, for reasons of ease, most commercially oriented neuromorphic efforts are digital.', 'Commercial applications envisaged fall into two main categories.One, which is where SpiNNcloud is focused, is in providing a more energy efficient and higher performance platform for AI applications – including image and video analysis, speech recognition and the large-language models that power chatbots such as ChatGPT.Another is in ""edge computing"" applications – where data is processed not in the cloud, but in real time on connected devices, but which operate on power constraints. Autonomous vehicles, robots, cell phones and wearable technology could all benefit.Technical challenges, however, remain. Long regarded as a main stumbling block to the advance of neuromorphic computing generally is developing the software needed for the chips to run.While having the hardware is one thing, it must be programmed to work, and that can require developing from scratch a totally different style of programming to that used by conventional computers. “The potential for these devices is huge… the problem is how do you make them work,” sums up Mr Hutcheson, who predicts it will be at least a decade, if not two, before the benefits of neuromorphic computing are really felt.There are also issues with cost. Whether they use silicon, as the commercially oriented efforts do, or other materials, creating radically new chips is expensive, notes Prof Kenyon.', ""Intel’s current prototype neuromorphic chip is called Loihi 2.In April, the company announced it had brought together 1,152 of them to create Hala Point, a large-scale neuromorphic research system comprising more than 1.15 billion fake neurons and 128 billion fake synapses.With a neuron capacity roughly equivalent to an owl brain, Intel claims is the world’s largest system to date.At the moment it is still a research project for Intel. “[But Hala Point] is showing that there's some real viability here for applications to use AI,” says Mike Davies, director of Intel’s neuromorphic computing lab. About the size of a microwave oven, Hala Point is “commercially relevant” and “rapid progress” is being made on the software side, he says. "", 'IBM calls its latest brain-inspired prototype chip NorthPole.Unveiled last year, it is an evolution of its previous TrueNorth prototype chip. Tests show it is more energy efficient, space efficient and faster than any chip currently on the market, says Dharmendra Modha, the company’s chief scientist of brain-inspired computing.  He adds that his group is now working to demonstrate chips can be dialed together into a larger system.“Path to market will be at story to come,” he says. One of the big innovations with NorthPole, notes Dr Modha, is that it has been co-designed with the software so the full capabilities of the architecture can be exploited from the get-go.Other smaller neuromorphic companies include BrainChip, SynSense and Innatera.', 'SpiNNcloud’s supercomputer commercialises neuromorphic computing developed by researchers at both TU Dresden and the University of Manchester, under the umbrella of the EU’s Human Brain Project.Those efforts have resulted in two research-purpose neuromorphic supercomputers: the SpiNNaker1 machine based at the University of Manchester consisting of over one billion neurons, and operational since 2018.A second generation SpiNNaker2 machine at TU Dresden, which is currently in the process of being configured, has the capacity to emulate at least five billion neurons. The commercially available systems offered by SpiNNcloud can reach an even higher level of at least 10 billion neurons, says Mr Gonzalez.The future will be one of different types of computing platforms - conventional, neuromorphic and quantum, which is another novel type of computing also on the horizon - all working together, says Prof Kenyon.']"

""People saved money, took time to think about what to do with it, and many of them decided that it was better invested on their roof than in their bank.""Meanwhile, the government introduced ambitious new targets, including covering 81% of Spain’s electricity needs with renewables by 2030.', 'However, behind this success story, there are concerns within the electricity industry caused by an imbalance between supply and demand with, at times, a surplus of electricity.Even though the Spanish economy has bounced back strongly from the trauma of the Covid pandemic, and is growing faster than all of the bloc’s other big economies, electricity consumption has been dropping in recent years.Last year, demand for electricity was even below that seen in the pandemic year 2020, and the lowest since 2003.""What we saw until 2005 was that when GDP increased, demand for electricity increased more than GDP,"" says Miguel de la Torre Rodríguez, head of system development at Red Eléctrica (REE), the company that operates Spain\'s national grid.More recently, he says, ""we\'ve seen that demand has increased less than GDP. What we\'re seeing is a decoupling of energy intensity from the economy"".', 'There are several reasons for the recent drop in demand. They include the energy crisis triggered by Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which caused businesses and homes across Europe to cut back on usage.Also, energy efficiency has improved and become more commonplace.The increased usage of renewable energy has also contributed to the reduction in demand for electricity from the national grid.Mr Rodríguez says that during daylight hours, when solar energy output is particularly strong, the supply-demand balance can be pushed out of kilter, having an impact on prices.""Since the power system always has to have an equilibrium – demand has to equal generation – that has meant there has been excess generation during those hours,"" he says. ""That has driven prices down, especially during certain hours, when the prices have been zero or even negative.""', 'While such low prices are welcome for consumers, they are potentially a problem when it comes to attracting investment to the industry.""This can make it more difficult for investors to increase their investment in new electricity based on renewable energies,"" says Sara Pizzinato, a renewable energy expert at Greenpeace Spain. ""That can be a bottleneck for the energy transition.""Concerns about Spain having an excess of electricity have led to discussion of the need to accelerate the ""electrification"" of the economy, which involves moving it away from fossil fuels. The Sánchez government has set a target of making 34% of the economy reliant on electricity by 2030.""This process is going slowly, and we need to accelerate it,"" says UNEF’s José Donoso. ""Electricity is the cheapest and most competitive way to produce clean energy.""We need facilities that use electricity in place of fossil fuels.""', 'Shifting to a total reliance on electricity is seen as unrealistic, as some important sectors like chemicals and metals will find the transition difficult.However, Mr Donoso and others see plenty of scope for swifter electrification. For example, Spain is trailing many of its European neighbours when it comes to the installation of heat pumps in homes, and the use of electric cars, which only make up around 6% of vehicles on the road.Ms Pizzinato agrees that electrification is crucial, but says there are other ways of tackling the supply-demand quandary, including phasing out the use of nuclear plants more quickly, and increasing energy storage capability.She says: ""We need to engage more people and more industries in demand-side management, to make sure the flexibility needed in the system is out there to make generation and demand match better during the day and during the night.""', ""Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

The battle for Gen Z social shoppers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511p8gdn21o#2,"If TikTok is banned in the US, where might its social shoppers go?","Thu, 13 Jun 2024 23:09:47 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265962,"['Shopping habits have not been the same since the Covid pandemic and resulting lockdowns.For many, and particularly younger shoppers, it saw the lines blur between social media and e-commerce.Unable to shop in person, and with TikTok downloads soaring, a trend began that would go on to be described as a cultural phenomenon: #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt.The hashtag, where users post what they’ve bought thanks to recommendations about products on the app, has now been posted more than seven billion times.For Lilia Souri and AJ Pulvirenti who co-host the marketing podcast ""Gen Z on Gen Z"" by creative agency Movers+Shakers, TikTok is winning with their generation.""It’s become one of the biggest because of how advanced the algorithm is, and because, before TikTok Shop even was created, we were seeing shopping behaviours happening on TikTok as a whole,” says 27-year-old Lilia Souri.“You can purchase a product directly on the platform, and then continue scrolling, in a cycle of watch, shop, repeat,” her co-host AJ Pulvirenti, 25, adds.Social shopping is a big market and growing fast. In 2023 globally it was worth $570bn (£446bn), and is forecast to be worth more than a trillion dollars by 2028, according to estimates by Statista.Listen: The battle for Gen Z social shoppers', ""While TikTok is one of the big players, its position looks vulnerable. TikTok could be banned in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance.So where would that leave social shopping?If you look at the number of buyers, then Facebook is still the biggest presence in social shopping, according to Jasmine Enberg, chief social media analyst at E Marketer.Most of its transactions take place on Facebook Marketplace, “one of the few places where Gen-Z and young people still go to on Facebook,” she adds.But if you're looking at the percentage of users who actually buy something, then TikTok is ahead, says Ms Enberg.Data from US-based E-marketer suggests 40% of TikTok users in the US will make at least one purchase on the platform this year, in front of both Facebook and Instagram.“It’s a very important activity on the app, especially for its users,” says Ms Enberg.Keen not to be left out, Amazon added a Consult-a-Friend feature last year, allowing customers to ask friends for advice while scrolling through its app.Gen Z podcaster AJ Pulvirenti is sceptical about these new features.“When a platform just tries to replicate something from another platform and doesn't offer anything very new or intriguing about it, it's not going to make people feel inclined to switch from something that they're used to,” he says.A recent study by market-research firm Data.ai suggests that Gen Z spend around two hours a day on TikTok, compared to a little less than 10 minutes on Amazon."", 'Perhaps TikTok\'s experience in Indonesia might have some useful lessons.In 2021 it became the first country to pilot the app\'s e-commerce service, and became one of the biggest markets for TikTok Shop.But with local commerce suffering in the wake of the pandemic, the government introduced rules last October to protect local retailers, which forced TikTok Shop to close. For 26-year-old entrepreneur Evo Syah it was a major blow.“It’s hard for me, but what I can do?” he says recalling the tough decisions he had to make.“I just start my business for one year, and then they shut me down,” he says.But two months after the closure, TikTok agreed to invest $1.5bn in Indonesia’s biggest e-commerce platform Tokopedia, meaning sellers like Evo Syah and millions of others could return to the app.The 26-year-old said he “never felt happier”. But not everything went back to normal.""Before the TikTok shop closed I could get sales like 20 million rupiah (£966) daily. But after it reopened again that’s down to 10 million rupiah (£483),” he says.Mr Syah sells most of his products on livestreams, a selling method which has boomed in popularity in Asia, but according to Ms Enberg has failed to take off in the UK and US.“Indonesia is a very different commerce landscape to the US,” she says.However, in both Indonesia and the US,  TikTok Shop has been crucial for a lot of small and local merchants, she adds.“Many of them don\'t really have another place that is as powerful as TikTok.”', 'Looking ahead to a potential US ban, Ms Enberg says it would send ripples through the world of social shopping. “Instagram Reels is the most natural fit for a lot of displaced TikTok users. But we\'ll probably also see a rise of new apps.""Gen Z podcast hosts AJ Pulvirenti and Lilia Souri agree: “In a world where maybe TikTok is banned. Those behaviours are still going to exist and they\'re still going to thrive,” Lilia says.“In a world where this may happen. I think this next big thing has yet to be created,” adds AJ.']"
'We are creating new crops five-times faster',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9xxjx7e2gjo#2,How artificial intelligence is increasingly helping the arable farming sector.,"Wed, 12 Jun 2024 23:06:31 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.266075,"['Like the bosses of many food companies, Jeremy Bunch is worried about the impact of climate change on his business.“Weather and the climate are maybe the number one risk to our company,” says the boss of US flour firm Shepherd’s Grain.Based in Idaho, the business sources wheat from farmers across the US Pacific northwest.As weather patterns become more unpredictable, Mr Bunch says: “I need to have a plan B, and plan C, in case plan A fails.”To help strengthen these plans, Mr Bunch’s company is now using an AI-powered software system called ClimateAi.Using current and past data, such as from satellite imagery and temperature and rainfall readings, and combining that with future projections, ClimateAi aims to give farmers the most accurate possible, locally-tailored weather forecasts, from one hour to six months ahead.It then advises on exactly when to plant and harvest particular crops, and predicts their yields.', 'Shepherd’s Grain only started using ClimateAi last year, but already most of its 40 plus farmers are now being guided by the app.“They’re beginning to look at ClimateAi to help them plan for crop management decisions in their wheat crops, the primary crop grown in the region,” says Mr Bunch.“A forward look at the weather helps our growers decide which crops to plant. The platform knows when to plant, and when the crop will start flowering and producing seed.”One of the biggest problems facing the seed industry is how to launch climate resilient seeds to market faster and cheaper, says Himanshu Gupta, chief executive of San Francisco-based ClimateAi.“By the time some seed companies do this, in say 10 to 15 years, the climate has already changed,” says Mr Gupta. “We are running against time to launch new seed varieties.”He says that ClimateAi helps these firms to see how specific test seeds have performed in a particular region or locality. “This can help seed companies figure out the optimal locations for growing seeds.”', 'Last year, a study published in scientific journal Nature warned of the potentially dire consequences of numerous crop failures happening at the same time around the world, as a result of the impact of climate change.“Simultaneous harvest failures across major crop-producing regions are a threat to global food security,” said the report, which was led by climate scientist Kai Kornhuber from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.This warning comes as the world population is expected to reach 10 billion people by 2050, up from eight billion currently, according to the United Nations.With increased pressure on crops, at the same time as the global population continues to grow, could AI be key to developing new varieties that can better cope with extremes of weather?', 'In the city of Arusha in Tanzania, David Guerena, agricultural scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, is leading a project called Artemis.Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, this is using AI to help breed more resilient crops. Specifically the AI is helping speed up work called phenotyping.This is the visual studying of new crop varieties based on observations of their characteristics, such as how many flowers, pods or leaves that a plant has.“Traditionally it takes around 10 years to develop a new crop variety,” explains Mr Guerena. “But given the pace of climate change, this timeframe is no longer viable.""He adds that the phenotyping work traditionally relied on the human eye. “But humans are just not doing this consistently, with the high levels of precision necessary, to make subtle, yet important, plant selections,” says Mr Guerena.“It can be over 30˚C in the field. It’s just tiring, and fatigue affects data quality.”Instead, growers involved in the project are taking photos of their crops through an app on a smartphone.  The trained AI can then quickly analyses, records, and reports what it sees.“Computers can count every flower or pod, from every plant, every day without getting tired,” says Mr Guerena. “This is really important as the number of flowers in bean plants correlate to the number of pods which directly influence yields.“Data can be so complicated, to understand what’s happening, but AI can be used to make sense of that complicated data and pick up patterns, show where we need resources, show recommendations.“Our plant breeders estimate that with the better data from the AI computer vision they may be able to shorten the breeding cycle to only a few years.”', 'In North Carolina, Avalo is an agriculture technology or “agri-tech” business also working to create climate-resilient crops. It does this by using AI to help study a crop’s genetics.“Our process starts with genomic data about crops, for example, the sequences of various varieties,” says Rebecca White, Avalo’s chief operating officer.“For example, with different tomatoes, there’s some small differences in genomes that give them different traits, for example different flavours, pesticide-resilient profiles. Our machine-learning programme is able to take these small differences across a number of varieties and see which genomes are important for what traits.”Using their tech they have been able to create a broccoli that matures in a greenhouse in 37 days rather than the standard 45 to 60 days, says Ms White.“Broccoli produced on that timescale can get additional growth cycles, and it saves carbon footprint and improves the environmental impact.”Avalo, which works with companies in Asia and North America, is also working to make rice resistant to frost, and potatoes more tolerant to drought.“Our core technologies can identify the genetic basis of complex traits with minimal training and, via sequencing and predictive analysis, quickly and inexpensively assess and model new plant varieties,” says Ms White.“We are creating new varieties for diverse crops that are developed five-times faster and for a fraction of the cost compared to traditional breeding.”', 'However, while AI can help mitigate the impact of climate-related weather, and enhance crop resilience, there are a number of challenges when it comes to using AI in agriculture, says Kate E Jones, professor of ecology and biodiversity at University College London.“The effectiveness of AI in ensuring food security also depends on addressing challenges such as data quality, technology accessibility… while acknowledging that AI is one tool among many in a comprehensive strategy for sustainable and resilient agriculture.”']"
'Insane' amounts of data spurs new storage tech,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd116m3jyn1o#2,Storing information with holograms and in glass is being proposed to deal with a deluge of data.,"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 23:03:29 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.266188,"['The year 2039 might seem like a long way off, but Ian Crawford is already planning for it.It will mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War Two - a big year for his employer, the Imperial War Museum. Mr Crawford is chief information officer at the museum, and oversees a project to digitise its huge collection of pictures, audio and film.With a collection of around 24,000 hours of film and video, and 11 million photographs, it\'s a vast task. And in the run-up to 2039, World War II material will be a priority.Making digital copies of those historical sources is vital as the original copies degrade over time, and will, one day, be lost forever. ""When you\'ve got the only copy, you want confidence that your storage system is reliable,"" says Ian Crawford.The amount of data needed for such long-term storage is growing all the time, as the latest scanners can record documents and films in great detail.""It\'s potential to grow is enormous really,"" says Mr Crawford.""We\'re now looking at objects themselves and scanning in 3D - that can generate very large files.""', 'This deluge of data is not just hitting museums - it\'s pouring down everywhere.Businesses are buying more space for back-up data, hospitals need somewhere to store records, government needs a place to stash increasing amounts of information.""We are continuing to create insane amounts of data,"" says Simon Robinson, principal analyst at research firm Enterprise Strategy Group.""For most organisations - it varies a lot - their data volume is doubling every four to five years. And in some industries it is growing much faster than that,"" he says. Data that needs to be held for a long time is not stored in traditional data centres, those vast warehouses, with racks of servers and blinking lights. Those operations are designed for data that needs to be accessed and updated frequently.Instead, the most popular way to keep data for the long-term is on tape. In particular a format known as  LTO (Linear Tape Open), the latest version being called LTO-9.The tapes themselves are not unlike old VHS tapes, but a bit smaller and more square. Inside the cassette is a kilometre of magnetic tape, capable of storing 18 terabytes of data. That\'s a lot - just one tape can hold the same amount of data as almost 300 standard smartphones.The Imperial War Museum in Duxford uses a tape system from Spectra Logic. The machine, around the size of a large wardrobe, can hold up to 1,500 LTO tapes.Such LTO systems dominate the market for long-term storage. They have been around for decades, and have proved themselves to be reliable.It\'s also pretty cheap, which is important as generally customers want to pay as little as possible for long-term storage.', 'Nevertheless some are convinced it can be done better.In a former wallpaper factory in Chiswick, west London, a start-up firm has been developing a long-term storage system that uses lasers to burn tiny holograms into a light-sensitive polymer.Chief executive Charlie Gale points out that with magnetic tape, data can only be stored on the surface, whereas holograms can store data in multiple layers.""You can do things called multiplexing, whereby you can layer multiple sets of information in one space. That\'s really kind of the superpower of what we\'re doing. And we believe we can put more information in less space than ever before,"" he says.HoloMem\'s polymer blocks can handle extreme temperatures, without the data becoming corrupted - between -14C to 160C.', ""By comparison, magnetic tape needs to be kept between 16C and 25C, which means significant heating and cooling costs, particularly in countries with extreme temperatures.Tape also needs replacing after around 15 years, whereas the polymer is good for at least 50 years.Mr Gale notes that, as the laser chemically changes the polymer, the data can't be tampered with, once it has been written.Holomem's prototype system, which will be able to store and retrieve data, will be ready later this year.Mr Gale says the cost of the system has been kept down by using standard, widely available components, including the laser - so, he's confident that HoloMem will be able to match, or beat the costs of magnetic tape."", 'HoloMem will need to be competitive, as looming over the market is a formidable competitor.Through its research arm, Microsoft is developing its own long-term data storage system.Like HoloMem it has decided that it\'s time to move on from magnetic tape, but Microsoft has chosen glass as it storage material.Called Project Silica, the system uses powerful lasers to create tiny structural changes in the glass, called voxels that can be used to store data. The voxels are incredibly small and can be packed into layers.Microsoft says that a 2mm thick piece of glass about the size of a DVD would be able to store more than seven terabytes of data.The system stores the glass panes on racks, where they can be accessed by small crab-like robots that zip along rails.Cheap and durable, glass is an attractive storage medium says Richard Black, who heads up Project Silica.""It\'s pretty much immune to temperature, humidity, particulates, electromagnetic fields,"" says Mr Black.It could potentially preserve data for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years.Such a system could, one day, be integrated into Microsoft\'s huge cloud computing business, Azure.But that is some way off as the system has years of development ahead of it.', 'Back in Duxford, the Imperial War Museum, like many organisations, has been experimenting with artificial intelligence. They recently tested whether AI could identify different models of Spitfire in pictures from its image catalogue.Mr Crawford thinks that AI could be incredibly useful in cataloguing its digital library, work that would take humans hundreds of years. The ability of AI to trawl through vast amounts of data has made keeping that data even more important - there could be something valuable lurking there.""In the past business was archiving data just in case they needed it.

At the heart of his plan to boost the country\'s economic growth are changes to the planning system, aimed at making it easier to build houses and infrastructure.Proposals to give local leaders more powers, bring the railways into public ownership and increase workers\' rights were also included.Some proposed pieces of legislation, first introduced by the last government, have been revived including Rishi Sunak\'s gradual smoking ban and the introduction of a football regulator.However, there were some notable omissions, with no mention of scrapping the two-child benefit cap - which some Labour MPs and the SNP have been pushing for. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader and now independent MP for Islington North, joined the calls to ""do it now"" and suggested the announcement of a child poverty taskforce was a way to ""just delay it"".He said: ""Why not do it now and just say quite simply, \'we\'re going to end the cap\'? ""It\'s simply cruel and nasty to say that the third, fourth or fifth child of a family is less valuable than the first two.""A bill implementing Labour\'s manifesto promise to give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote in general elections was also missing but ministers say this will be introduced at a later stage. Green Party MP Sian Berry said she was disappointed as ""young people need a real voice"", adding she believed they would help strengthen the calls to remove the two-child cap.Labour backbencher Rebecca Long Bailey, a former shadow cabinet member, also called on her party to urgently ""settle the debt of honour we owe"" to women born in the 1950s who suffered ""pension injustice"", known as the Waspi women.The speech was delivered by King Charles - accompanied by the traditional pageantry - but was written by the new Labour government, elected on 4 July with a big majority of 174.Following the King’s Speech, Conservative leader Mr Sunak said his party would not oppose the government “for the sake of it” but would hold it to account on its election promises.On Labour’s proposed changes to planning rules, he said everyone wanted to see the process speeded up but warned that “a system that does not allow local people to have a say will damage public consent for more housing in the long term”.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper welcomed a promise to reform the Mental Health Act but said she wanted to see more ambition on health and social care.

In the government\'s briefing notes, it argued that one of the ""major brakes"" on economic growth has been the current planning regime and used the King\'s Speech to introduce its Planning and Infrastructure Bill.The bill, which will apply to England, Wales and, in parts, to Scotland aims to accelerate the building of homes and infrastructure.Under the government\'s plans, the capacity of local planning departments will be boosted and the process for getting consent to infrastructure projects such as solar farms or grid connections simplified. The government says in future local communities will only be to able influence how, not if, new houses are built.Given Labour\'s hefty majority in the House of Commons, the planning bill is likely to get through Parliament.However, new developments could face vigorous opposition from the local communities affected by building projects.', ""Other measures the government hopes will bolster economic growth include its English Devolution Bill.The bill would give local leaders more powers over transport, skills and employment and make it easier to request further powers. The Better Buses Bill would allow local politicians to create publicly-owned bus operators. One bill would set up a National Wealth Fund to boost investment in infrastructure and green industry. Another will establish Great British Energy, a state-owned company to invest in renewable energy.When Mr Sunak called the general election in May, several government bills progressing through Parliament had to be ditched. The Labour government has now said it will reintroduce some of those pieces of legislation including the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which bans people born on or after 1 January 2009 from being able to buy cigarettes. The Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Bill would establish Martyn's Law, requiring premises to mitigate the impact of a potential terrorist attack. The measure has been campaigned for by Figen Murray, the mother of Martyn Hett, one of the 22 people killed in the 2017 terrorist attack on Manchester Arena. Downing Street says at least six of the bills outlined in the King's Speech will be introduced to Parliament this week. "", 'Responding to the speech, Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice said the government\'s policies would lead to higher taxes and more regulation. Green Party MP Ellie Chowns said she wanted to see ""bolder action"" on improving building standards and introducing rent controls. The SNP\'s Stephen Gethins said the ""biggest thing pulling back growth"" was Brexit and criticised the government for not using its big majority to reverse the ""hard Tory Brexit"". He also criticised the government for not removing the two-child benefit limit.The cap prevents households on universal credit or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. During the debate following the King\'s speech, former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said ditching the limit would lift 300,000 children out of poverty. Sir Keir has previously said he understood the objections to the cap but that removing it was currently unaffordable.After the King\'s Speech, the government announced a taskforce to deliver a child poverty strategy, to be led by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson.', 'Among other measures, the King\'s Speech also included:the Renters\' Rights Bill banning so-called no fault evictions and extending safety rules to private tenantsthe Water (Special Measures) Bill making the bosses of private water companies personally liable for lawbreakingthe Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill allowing police to use counter-terror powers to tackle gangs smuggling migrants into the UKthe draft Conversion Practices Bill introducing new restrictions on ""abusive"" practices intended to change people\'s sexual orientation or gender identitythe House of Lords (Hereditary Peers) Bill removing hereditary peers from the upper chamber.']"

Why the devil is in the 'devolution desert' detail,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0351175g87o#1,Deputy PM Angela Rayner wants to give more powers to local areas but delivery could be tricky.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 16:07:03 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.796021,"['The way local government works might not sound like the most exciting thing on the government’s long to-do list, but Keir Starmer has decided it matters.Why? Because the prime minister has made economic growth a priority, and it’s the government’s view that local leaders across England have a vital role to play in helping to achieve that.So what’s the plan, and crucially: can it work?At the moment devolution - the powers that have been handed down from Westminster to local authorities across England - is patchy.Some areas, like Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, have elected mayors with control over things like housing, skills and transport which is meant to help them boost local growth.Other areas are working on deals that would see powers handed down to groups of councils working together.But the powers - and the funding - that have been handed down vary widely from place to place, and there are some parts of England that aren’t covered at all.', 'The Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, has written to councils in these areas that are described as “devolution deserts” inviting them to work with the government on plans to give them more power in their local areas.The claim is that those with “skin in the game” can make better decisions over what’s needed in their area.The idea is broadly welcome across the local government sector, but the devil will be in the detail and it won’t be without difficulty.The last Conservative government embarked on a programme of devolution, but it often ran into long and complex negotiations over geography or governance - exactly which bodies in which areas should have power and how they should be accountable to the public.The Labour government has made clear it likes the idea of elected mayors; Keir Starmer even invited the existing mayors to Downing Street in his first week in office.But not every area thinks a mayor is the right solution. In Bristol residents voted to scrap the idea of an elected mayor during a referendum in 2022.', ""The County Councils Network, which represents some of England’s largest local authorities often in rural areas, welcomes the government’s approach to devolution.However, it says that while “there are benefits to mayors or directly-elected leaders, the reality is they are unsuitable for some county areas” - adding that not having one should not inhibit a region’s ambition.In her letter to councils, Angela Rayner has made clear the government sees the advantages of metro mayors but won’t “force” them on any local area, instead inviting regions to come up with devolution proposals by the end of September.The government is clearly pitching partnership to a sector that has often felt overlooked, but delivering devolution hasn’t always been simple.And there’s another issue too.The financial strain facing local authorities is well-documented, with huge pressure on budgets for social care, children's services and housing in particular.Ms Rayner, who is also the housing, communities and local government secretary, says in her letter that the cabinet understands the pressure many councils are under and will ensure they “have the resources to deliver new devolved powers and functions.”Again, the devil will be in the detail.The government’s argument is that boosting economic growth will allow investment in public services, and clearly ministers believe giving more power to local leaders to make decisions for their area is a key part of that.But finding a way to make it work in practice for a sector that’s already under strain is what will count.""]"

She added that she ""looked forward"" to meeting him and Donald Trump if they won the US election in November.', 'His comments on the UK becoming an “Islamist country” were a direct criticism of Labour’s approach to immigration, and he also said that the Tories “have got to get a handle on this”. Right-wing US political figures have often linked immigration to a rise in Islamism in a country and have regularly focused on the UK.During his speech to the National Conservatism conference Mr Vance made several further comments attacking immigration.He declared: ""The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more.""In the speech Mr Vance also said “I was in London last year, and it’s not doing so good” referring to both high house prices and high immigration, making a link between those.Speaking on ITV, Ms Rayner said: ""I\'m very proud of the election success that Labour had recently.""We won votes across all different communities, across the whole of the country, and we\'re interested in governing on behalf of Britain and also working with our international allies.""Mr Vance\'s comments were also criticised by Exchequer Secretary James Murray.Mr Murray told Sky News: ""I don\'t know what he was driving at in that comment, to be honest. I mean, in Britain, we\'re very proud of our diversity.""I\'m very proud that we have a new government, I\'m very proud that our Labour government is committed to national security and economic growth. I\'m very clear where we are. ""I don\'t really know how that comment fits in.""Foreign Secretary David Lammy has spent recent months consciously seeking to forge strong relations with Donald Trump’s allies, among them Mr Vance.Mr Lammy met Mr Vance alongside several Trump allies during a goodwill mission to the US in May, describing him as his ""friend"".In a speech at the right-leaning Hudson Institute in Washington in May, Mr Lammy said Mr Vance was ""right to say we in Europe have a problem that we need to fix with higher defence expenditure"".He also said Trump has been “often misunderstood” when it comes to Nato, that he “gets the agenda that drives America First”, and that he would find “common cause” with a Trump administration.But Mr Vance\'s selection could pose a challenge for the new Labour government if Trump returns to the White House.Former US President Trump has opted for one of the most isolationist members of the Republican Party. The former Trump-critic, now Trump-evangelist, opposes aiding Ukraine - while Sir Keir Starmer has committed to spending £3bn on aid for Ukraine for ""as long as it takes"".On Tuesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson met Trump on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.""We discussed Ukraine and I have no doubt that he will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy,"" Mr Johnson posted on X. ', 'Mr Vance has also criticised Europe\'s overdependence on the US in foreign policy - potentially straining US-UK relations. Regardless of Mr Vance’s recent intervention, Labour believes their diplomacy with Trump’s team is beginning to bear fruit. Labour sources point to Sir Keir\'s conversation with the ex-president on Sunday in the aftermath of the assassination attempt - the first time the pair had spoken.Andrew Bowie, the shadow veterans minister, said he ""absolutely"" disagreed with the claim that Labour was creating an ""Islamist country"".He told Times Radio: ""I disagree with the Labour Party fundamentally on many issues, but I do not agree with that view, quite frankly.

Shoplifting crackdown expected to be unveiled,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngk8yp3v4o#1,"Measures to target ""low-value"" shoplifting and the abuse of shop workers are due to be announced in the King's Speech.","Tue, 16 Jul 2024 16:28:59 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.796413,"['A crackdown on shoplifting is expected to be announced in the King\'s Speech on Wednesday.The government is due to unveil a new crime bill to target people who steal goods worth less than £200.The policy would be a reversal of 2014 legislation that meant ""low-value"" thefts worth under £200 were subject to less serious punishment.The government is also expected to introduce a specific offence of assaulting a shop worker to its legislative agenda.It will not be clear until legislation passes through Parliament what the punishments for any new or strengthened offences would be. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that last year was the worst on record for shoplifting in England and Wales. Police recorded over 430,000 offences in those nations in 2023 - though retailers say underreporting means these figures are likely to represent only a fraction of the true number of incidents.', 'Michelle Whitehead, who works at a convenience store in Wolverhampton, said her shop had been ""hit every day"" by thieves.People were stealing ""absolutely anything"" including ""tins of spam, tins of corned beef, all the fresh meat"", Ms Whitehead told BBC Radio 4\'s World at One programme. ""They’re just coming in, getting their whole arm and sweeping the lot off the shelves,"" she said. ""The shelves were always empty.""She said she believed ""organised"" criminal gangs, rather than individuals struggling with the cost of living, were behind the thefts in her shop.The crackdown on ""low-value"" shoplifting ""will help a lot of little shops,"" Ms Whitehead said. While retailers and shop workers have welcomed the anticipated proposals, a civil liberties group has raised concerns about criminalising people struggling to make ends meet and overburdening the prison system. The new legal measures are expected to be announced as part of the King\'s Speech on Wednesday, a key piece of the State Opening of Parliament that allows the government to outline its priorities over the coming months. Before the general election, the Labour Party pledged to reverse what it described as the ""shoplifter\'s charter"" - a piece of 2014 legislation that reduced the criminal punishment for ""low-value shoplifting"".Tom Holder, spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium (BRC), told BBC News the impact of the 2014 legislation has been to ""deprioritise it in the eyes of police"". ""I think police would be less likely to turn up to what they see as low-level theft,"" he said.  Shoplifting cost retailers £1.8 billion in the last year, which could impact prices, according to the BRC. ""Shoplifting harms everyone in that sense - those costs eventually get made up somewhere, whether it\'s prices going up or other prices that can\'t come down,"" Mr Holder said. Co-op campaigns and public affairs director Paul Gerrard said the supermarket chain had also recorded rising theft and violence against shop workers.""There’s always been people who will steal to make ends meet. That’s not what is behind the rise we’ve seen,"" he told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme on Tuesday. ""What’s behind that rise is individuals and gangs targeting large volumes of stock in stores for resale in illicit venues like pubs, clubs, markets, and out the back of cars.""But Jodie Beck, policy and campaigns officer at civil liberties organisation Liberty, had concerns about the expected proposals, saying there is ""already a wide range of powers"" the police can use to tackle shoplifting and anti-social behaviour levelled at retail staff.Ms Beck said the ""£200 threshold"" would not just target criminal gangs but also ""people who are pushed into the desperate situation of not paying for things"" because they cannot afford to make ends meet.She urged the government to avoid focusing on ""criminal justice and policing solutions instead of doing the thoughtful work of looking at the root causes of crime, which we believe are related to poverty and inequality"".Ms Beck also argued the additional legislation could serve to worsen the UK\'s ""enormous court backlog"" and its ""bursting prison system"".Last week, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced plans to release thousands of prisoners early to ease overcrowding in the country\'s prisons.A spokesperson for Downing Street said the government would not comment on the King\'s Speech until it has been delivered by the monarch.A National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesperson said the organisation had worked with the government last year to develop the Retail Crime Action Plan, to reduce commercial theft.The plan involves treating shoplifting as organised crime. ""Police forces have embedded the plan in their operational work and we’re already seeing positive results,"" they added.']"

Recruitment is failing to match retention, with many soldiers and officers complaining about neglected and substandard accommodation.The Royal Navy, which has spent vast sums on its two centrepiece aircraft carriers, is in need of many more surface ships to fulfil its tasks around the globe.Its ageing fleet of nuclear-armed Vanguard submarines, the cornerstone of the UK’s strategic defence and known as the Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), is overdue for replacement by four Dreadnought class submarines and costs are mounting.Commenting on the review, Mr Healey said: “Hollowed-out armed forces, procurement waste and neglected morale cannot continue.”', 'The defence and security threats facing the UK, Nato and its allies further afield are multiple.They include a war raging on Europe’s eastern flank in Ukraine against Russia’s full-scale invasion. The UK, along with the EU and Nato, has opted to help defend Ukraine with multi-billion pound packages of weapons and aid, stopping short of committing combat troops.The policy behind this is not entirely altruistic. European governments, especially those closest to Russia like Poland and the Baltic states, fear that if President Putin wins the war in Ukraine it will not be long before he rebuilds his army and invades them next.Some of those countries are already busy beefing up their own defence spending closer to 3% or even 4% of GDP.The challenge for Nato has been how to provide Ukraine with as much weaponry as it can, without provoking Russia into retaliating against a Nato state and risk triggering a third world war.The Royal Navy has been in action recently in the Red Sea, where it has been operating alongside the US Navy in fending off attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.But the UK has also made naval commitments further afield in the South China Sea with the Aukus pact, comprising of Australia, UK and the US, aimed at containing Chinese expansion in the region.Critics have questioned whether a financially-constrained UK can afford to make commitments like this on the other side of the world.Closer to home in Europe, there is a growing threat from so-called “hybrid warfare” attacks, suspected of coming from Russia.These are anonymous, unattributable attacks on undersea pipelines and telecoms cables on which Western nations depend.As tensions increase with Moscow there are fears such actions will only increase and the UK cannot possibly hope to guard all of its coastline all of the time.', 'But while those nervous Nato partners living close to Russia’s borders are busy beefing up their defence spending closer to 3 or even 4% of GDP, the UK has so far declined to put a timetable on when it will raise its own defence spending to just 2.5%.Opposition figures have criticised the government for refusing to say when defence spending will be increased.Before his election defeat, former prime minister Rishi Sunak committed to reaching 2.5% by 2030.Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge previously said: ""In a world that is more volatile and dangerous than at any time since the Cold War, Keir Starmer’s Labour government had a clear choice to match the Conservatives’ fully funded pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030.""By failing to do so, they’ve created huge uncertainty for our armed forces, at the worst possible time.”']"

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the programme, which is expected to focus on economic growth, will show urgency and that “there is no time to waste”.Sir Keir has said the government “is serious about delivering the stability that is going to turbo charge growth”.But as well as economic measures, it is a chance for the new government to set out its key priorities in other areas.The programme is also expected to bring back legislation to introduce Martyn\'s Law, named after Manchester Bombing victim Martyn Hett.The proposed law, which had been promised by Rishi Sunak, would require venues and local authorities to have preventative plans to deal with terror attacks.Plans were introduced in the last Parliament but did not pass before it was wound up before the election, which prompted Martyn\'s mother, Figen Murray, to say she felt ""let down"" by Mr Sunak.The spiking law will apply in England and Wales. Any further measures in Scotland and Wales will be for devolved politicians.']"

Starmer commits to BBC licence fee,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c047pmx47rno#1,The prime minister has ruled out any changes to how the BBC is funded at least until 2027.,"Sat, 13 Jul 2024 09:10:17 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.799025,"['Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out changes to how the BBC is funded until at least 2027. “We are committed in our manifesto to the BBC and to the licensing scheme,” the prime minister said during his trip to Washington DC this week.The BBC has faced real terms cuts in recent years, including a two-year freeze on the licence fee, leading to cuts to services and programmes.The Conservative government suggested in 2022 it would abolish the licence fee when its charter was up for renewal and move towards a voluntary funding model. But signalling his commitment to the existing model, Sir Keir said: “There’s going to be some more thought between now and [2027], but we are committed to the BBC and we are committed to the licensing arrangements.""Among programmes impacted by recent cuts was BBC Two\'s Newsnight, which was stripped back as part of efforts to find £500m in savings.The licence fee was frozen at £159 for two years by Nadine Dorries when she was culture secretary in Boris Johnson’s government.The Conservative government and the BBC agreed a six-year deal which included the two-year freeze, with annual increases set to follow inflation from 2024 until March 2028.But the Conservatives in December decided against that deal, announcing a below-inflation rise of £10.50 per year to £169.50 coming in from 1 April.The BBC’s director general Tim Davie announced back in March that the corporation would explore how to reform the licence fee.The licence fee pays for BBC services including TV, radio, the BBC website, podcasts, iPlayer and apps.Its existence is guaranteed until at least 31 December 2027 by the BBC\'s royal charter, which sets out its funding and purpose.A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We remain totally focused on offering value to the public and will engage with the government on funding at the appropriate time.”']"

Thousands of prisoners to be released in September,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg5vp0296eo#1," Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood warns of a ""total breakdown of law and order"" unless action is taken.","Fri, 12 Jul 2024 18:47:31 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.799431,"['Thousands of prisoners will be released early at the start of September, the justice secretary has announced.Shabana Mahmood warned of the ""total collapse"" of the prison system and a ""total breakdown of law and order"" without urgent action to ease prison overcrowding.She accused Rishi Sunak and the previous Conservative government of a ""disgraceful dereliction of duty"" for not dealing with the crisis when they were in power. Under her plan, some prisoners will be released after they have served 40% of their sentence in England and Wales, rather than the current 50%. Ms Mahmood said she expected the first batch of prisoners released in September to be ""in the low thousands"", with further releases over the next 18 months and updates made to Parliament every three months. Over the next 18 months, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) told BBC Verify it estimated up to 4,000 extra male prisoners and fewer than 1,000 female prisoners will be released under the new measures. Sentences for serious violent offences of four years or more and sex offences will be automatically excluded from the change, as will the early release of offenders in prison for domestic abuse connected crimes, including stalking and choking. Speaking at HMP Five Wells in Northamptonshire, Ms Mahmood said jails had been operating at 99% capacity since the start of last year and were now weeks away from running out of space.If that happened overflow police cells would be filled, she warned, leading to ""van-loads of dangerous people circling the country with nowhere to go"".She added: ""Soon, the courts would grind to a halt, unable to hold trials.“With officers unable to act, criminals could do whatever they want, without consequence. ""We could see looters running amok, smashing in windows, robbing shops and setting neighbourhoods alight.""In short, if we fail to act now, we face the collapse of the criminal justice system. And a total breakdown of law and order.""', 'As Ms Mahmood painted a bleak picture she would have been aware that allowing some prisoners out early will not be popular with some people.But she stressed that she had been “left with no choice at all” blaming the previous Conservative government for the crisis. Ms Mahmood knows that the questions and criticism will quickly come her way if this scheme does not work or leads to a rise in offences.Conservative shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat said in a social media post: ""In what world is releasing 20,000 criminals onto our streets a good idea.""However, early release is not new, and the previous justice secretary Alex Chalk announced plans for some prisoners to be released up to two months early back in March under the Conservative government.Mr Chalk, who lost his seat at the general election, told the Today podcast there had also been plans to go further and release some prisoners after 40% of their sentence – as has been announced on Friday – and to send fewer people to jail in the first place. BBC News understands that several Conservative cabinet ministers supported the idea, but Rishi Sunak refused to sign it off and the election was called before the issue was resolved.The Ministry of Justice\'s (MoJ) weekly statistics suggest there are currently 1,451 prison cell spaces left across England and Wales, and an increase of 1,161 inmates over the past 12 months.Mark Icke, Vice-president of the Prison Governors Association (PGA), welcomed the announcement, saying the crisis is “unprecedented” and prison governors have been “warning for some time” that “we’ve got far too many prisoners in our system”.', 'Ex-Labour MP Harriet Harman believes that too many women are being locked up and says the criminal justice system should deal with them in a different way. ""Most women are in prison for very short sentences for non-violent crimes, [and] most themselves have been victims of violence as well,"" she told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme.""There is a very, very different pattern of men and women\'s offending"", Ms Harman said, giving the example of women in for drug offences being less likely to be gang leaders than men, and instead often being victims themselves.She added that 40% of women in UK jails are foreign nationals who should be serving sentences in their home countries. Conservative MP Greg Smith said the Ministry of Justice should focus on building more prisons to ease the pressure on prison places.He also argued it was ""a bit rich"" for Labour to claim they did not want to let prisoners out early.He told the BBC: ""I don\'t think Labour can pretend that this is anything other than something they would naturally do.""The chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor said ""this measure will inevitably lead to the early release of some risky offenders"" but a decision on how to tackle the issue ""needed to be taken and none would have been without risk"". Mr Taylor added the move would add to the workload of already stretched prison OMUs [Offender Management Units] and probation services"" so prison inspectors ""will be watching very closely"" for its impact.However, the aunt of murdered law graduate Zara Aleena has branded the plans a “dangerous gamble with the public safety”.Ms Aleena was murdered by Jordan McSweeney nine days after he was released from prison and while he was in the process of being recalled after his licence was revoked for failing to meet probation officers.Her aunt Farah Naz told BBC Breakfast that underfunding in the probation service, which monitors prisoners when they are released from prison midway through their sentence on licence, means offenders like McSweeney are not being properly supervised in the community.The Ministry of Justice is already building six new prisons to create an extra 20,000 places as demand grows for cell spaces, partially because of the Government\'s campaign to hire 20,000 more police officers.About 6,000 spaces have been created and about 10,000 will be built by the end of 2025.']"

While there is no specific offence of assisted suicide in Scotland, euthanasia is illegal and can be prosecuted as murder or culpable homicide.Trying to kill yourself is not by itself a criminal act.A bill to legalise assisted dying in the UK was defeated in 2015, but was backed by Sir Keir and several Tory cabinet members.He has previously said he thinks ""there are grounds for changing the law"".Opponents to changing the law say it is to protect the vulnerable and ensure that nobody is pressured into dying sooner than they might otherwise.Over 200,000 people signed a petition for a vote on assisted dying, leading to a debate in Parliament in April.There was no vote and the government remains neutral on the issue.Many shared stories related to losing relatives and loved ones, and how it informed their view on the topic of assisted dying.A private member\'s bill (PMB) is a proposed law change introduced by an MP, not the government.PMBs rarely become law without the support of government, as they do not get the same amount of time dedicated to government businesses.Free votes are common on matters to do with health, religion or military intervention.']"

""We were reduced to three [MPs] in 2019 - and that\'s how low our working class vote had become,"" he said.""We won a whole clutch of those seats back the other night, so I think working class communities have found a Labour Party they can vote for this time in a way that wasn\'t the case in recent elections.""He acknowledged there would be challenges in ""how to take this new opponent on"" but said Reform\'s biggest weaknesses were it\'s ""disparaging"" of the NHS and ""apologism for Putin"".Looking around the cabinet table on Saturday morning, the day after the landslide election victory, Mr McFadden said he had been ""struck"" by the fact that ""around that table are more people from ordinary backgrounds than has ever been in a Cabinet in British history"".

June was the quiet month then. Just the small matter of a general election campaign.And here we are in July, and Mr Gething is resigning.So will begin another leadership race, a new government in Wales, a new first minister and a new team of senior Welsh ministers.There will also be more arguments about Welsh Labour – its direction, its priorities, its capacity to govern effectively and its relationship with the UK party.If you’re watching this in Downing Street, it’s the last thing you need.']"

The new government has promised big steps - doubling onshore and quadrupling offshore turbines by 2030. By removing the ban on onshore wind in England just a few days into power, Labour wants to show this is a key priority.The announcement was welcomed by the industry, with reports of big developers such as Germany’s RWE and France’s EDF wanting to move ahead with new onshore projects. Overcoming local objections about the visual impact of land-based turbines will be vital. Community energy activists say public attitudes are changing, and the potential to offer discounts to local consumers is softening opposition.Offshore, Labour's plans face huge hurdles, with global shortages of materials and skills. The big change that’s needed will be making offshore investments more financially attractive.Last year, there were no takers at a government auction for new contracts to develop offshore wind, with firms saying the price set was far too low.

The summit allowed him to demonstrate his government’s support for Ukraine, confirming the UK would continue to provide £3bn in military aid each year.Sir Keir announced a strategic defence review would begin next week and said his commitment to spending 2.5% of national income on defence was “iron clad”. But he faced criticism for refusing to say when or how that target would be met.The challenge for the prime minister and other Nato allies will be how to remain united in their support for Ukraine, as not all are equally resolute. They must also plan for the possibility of a Trump presidency that could see a significant reduction in US military backing for Kyiv.', 'The number of people who are economically inactive due to ill health has risen by 700,000 since the pandemic, to 2.8 million. The government’s big idea to tackle rising levels of worklessness is to create a new national jobs and career service.  It would be based in job centres, but with local areas able to tailor the scheme depending on their own employment needs.Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has praised initiatives in Manchester, where the Greater Manchester Combined Authority has invested money in programmes such as Working Well. This helps people with health conditions and disabilities get “the right job, at the right time.”Who are the millions of people not working?The biggest challenge will be changing perceptions of job centres. For many, they aren’t places to find work and instead mean fearful encounters with officials focussed on ensuring claimants comply with benefit rules.  “Take a job - any job - or you’ll lose your benefits,” has been the message the unemployed have often left with.  If that image doesn’t change, the government’s plan could well be stymied.', 'Labour’s manifesto promised to scrap plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda and set up a new Border Security Command (BSC) to tackle the people smuggling gangs moving tens of thousands of people across the English Channel in inflatable boats.After taking up office, the prime minister swiftly confirmed the end of the Rwanda plan, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said there would be “rapid recruitment of an exceptional leader"" for the BSC.Labour said the new BSC would be partly funded by diverting £75m from the Rwanda policy, set up by the Conservatives in 2022. By the end of 2023, £240m had  been paid to Rwanda. However, Rwanda has said it will not be giving any money back.The one diplomatic mistake of Labour’s first week was its failure to inform the Rwandan government before announcing the end of the joint migration policy, which angered Kigali. Labour also promised to end the ""perma-backlog"" of asylum seekers whose claims are not being processed because of the Illegal Migration Act, which says people who arrive illegally cannot claim asylum. However, the new government has not said how it plans to deal with the estimated 100,000 people caught in this legal limbo.', 'Labour\'s so called ""crackdown"" on water companies includes ring-fencing money for infrastructure investment so it doesn\'t leak out into bonuses, dividends or pay increases. New customer panels will be able to summon water executives to answer for their performance. Compensation payments to households and businesses whose basic services are not up to standard will more than double.But water firms have said a proposed average 21% hike in bills in England and Wales by 2030 won\'t be enough to address problems including sewage leaks. It is a third less than the amount they requested. They are now in a stand-off with regulator Ofwat over how much prices can rise.What the government wants to avoid is having to nationalise a company like Thames Water, which is drowning in £18bn of debt and says it only has enough cash to last 11 months. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has warned nationalising water companies is not something it wants to do. He says it would “cost money we do not have” and slow down the process of reducing pollution levels.Labour is talking tough, but solving the stand-off between the firms and the regulator is one of the big issues it now has to resolve.', 'Jails in England and Wales are on the cusp of reaching full capacity and prison staff say they’re under immense pressure to find spaces that don’t necessarily exist.The Labour government wants to continue building new prison places announced by the Conservatives, but has not said when they will be completed.The government argues that it has had no choice but to announce it will release some prisoners early to free up urgently needed space. But releasing inmates comes with risk. The new government could be seen as soft on crime among those who support longer and tougher sentences. And what if one of those let out early goes on to commit another more serious offence? Ministers are going to have to be very careful who they release, with sources saying we could be looking at thousands let out in the autumn. Serious offenders such as rapists and murderers are exempt from the plans.']"
"Pomp, plans and power – what to expect in Labour’s King’s Speech",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckkgl37lp7no#2,"As the reality of power sets in for Labour ministers, expect few fireworks but plenty of big plans when Parliament is opened.","Sat, 13 Jul 2024 11:47:13 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.800600,"['“Oh god! We’ve got a Labour government!” A delighted member of the Cabinet told me reality only finally hit them when driving through their constituency on Friday, more than a week after voters sent the Tories packing.In the prime minister’s first seven days he’s been confronted with a deeply awkward situation abroad – President Joe Biden’s competence dominating the NATO summit. At home the justice secretary has felt compelled to plan early prisoner releases (it’s unusual a politician would make a willing choice to do that), and doubts over the survival of the steel plant in Port Talbot linger.In other words, Labour is already grappling with the tasks government requires them to do – not the options they would choose.But on Wednesday their own plans will take centre stage, with all the fuss and fanfare Westminster can summon – the attendance of the King, the giant golden throne (yes, really!), the trumpets, the frills and flounces.The first ‘King’s Speech’ will list the law the government hopes to pass in its first year of what Labour already hopes will be a decade in charge.', 'Do not expect Labour’s plans to include fireworks – no rabbits out of fancy hats. Another Cabinet minister said: ""‘We are still in the mode of no surprises, to do the job we are hired to do.”The speech, however, will be absolutely stuffed with plans. Ministers have vied with each other to get their proposals in. The message, I’m told, has been to do the work, get your stuff ready, and the sooner you can do that, the more likely you are to get a slot for it.The speech will be “rooted in Keir’s missions”, another source said – those “six first steps” that we heard about so much in the election. In case you can’t quite remember what they all were (like the now Health Secretary, Wes Streeting), you can refresh your memory here.', 'Wednesday is the start of a drawn-out process of passing at least 30 bills. It will include a couple of dozen new laws, and completing some unfinished business from the old government, as Labour starts to translate its manifesto into new life.Top of the list is getting the economy growing - No 10 and 11’s priority. So expect plans to shake up the planning system, encourage house building, and more powers for the government’s budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.Look out for plans to create Great British Energy, the government’s energy company, to expand workers’ rights, to create the National Wealth Fund - using the power of the public purse for long term investment - and to grant new powers to authorities round the country away from Westminster in the Take Back Control bill (get it?).', 'There are likely to be two new bills from the Home Office - a border security bill so people smugglers can be treated like terrorists and a crime bill to tackle antisocial behaviour and county lines drug trafficking.Plans to reform the Mental Health Act have been promised. Moving the rail industry into public ownership, votes for 16-year-olds and changes to the House of Lords have also been mooted.Rishi Sunak’s smoking ban is expected to be followed through, along with the former government’s vow to end no fault evictions, and to bring in ‘Martyn’s Law’ - legislation to force venues to be prepared for terror attacks, named after one of the victims of the Manchester Arena tragedy. Plans to strengthen the regulation of AI are on the way too.Ministers are under strict instruction not to be categoric about what has made the cut and what has not - even privately. A huge amount of work for the speech was done before Labour’s election win was secure, but the protocol is that these announcements are the monarch’s to make.So until the day itself, we cannot be completely sure if some of the more controversial plans have been passed over this time. Be alert too to the promise of “reviews” or “consultations”. Sometimes taking a good look at a problem before new laws is the logical thing to do – on other occasions, it is a way of placating those arguing for action when ministers aren’t quite ready.', 'If an idea hasn’t made it into the speech this time around, it doesn’t mean it will never happen. Governments are always able to put forward other laws at a later date. But the speech is the government’s formal to-do list, so Wednesday’s priorities are the government’s priorites.Remember, Labour is in a hurry to show they can get things done. Lots of effort has gone in to draft laws that are “tight” and “workable” I’m told, and are ”whole Parliament proof” – meaning laws that can get through the House of Lords.The government has a ginormous majority in the House of Commons, but they have a different audience on the red benches at the other end of the Palace of Westminster. They don’t want to be picking time-consuming fights with the Lords, or creating laws that could be gummed up with hundreds of possible amendments – helpful tweaks - from their lordships.Wednesday will be a huge moment. The buglers will bugle. Black Rod will bang the door. In a nod to the Gunpowder Plot of the 16th Century, the Yeomen of the Guard will conduct a ceremonial search for explosives. The King will wear the crown, and put his name to Labour’s plans for the next couple of years.Hundreds of new MPs will process through the Westminster’s historic halls. And Sir Keir Starmer’s project in Parliament officially begins.', 'Ministers have already been trying hard to tell a story of just how bad the state of the government is that they have inherited. ”You cannot overstate how dysfunctional it has been,” one minister told me. The Justice Secretary late on Friday even accused the Tories of being the “guilty men”.Clearly there is some information that is only available to those actually in government, but it is worth saying that much of the information new ministers are describing as a ‘shock’ - such as waiting lists and the size of the prison population - are a matter of public record. As we discussed last week, there was a conscious decision by Labour, before they won the election, to tell the public “it’s worse than we thought”. One former Tory minister said: “We need to call out this hokum”.Declarations of surprise also don’t quite match Labour’s boast at being incredibly well prepared for government after months of careful homework and talks with senior officials.But perhaps the shock of being in charge is genuine.  One member of the new government said: “I still wake up every morning thinking the previous day is a dream.”The power is real. And on Wednesday we’ll learn more about how Labour plans to use it.Top picture: Reuters', 'BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Which voters should the Tories go after now?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g6md2lxvo#2,The Conservatives are debating their future - but the path back to victory is not straightforward.,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 01:07:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.800893,"['The parliamentary Conservative party is dazed and confused, even grief-stricken.Many knew a big defeat was coming, though some were in denial. All agree that the reality of life in opposition is even worse than expected.“It’s like Lehman Brothers around here,” one Conservative MP muttered, as he saw yet another ousted colleague wander past carrying a cardboard box holding their belongings.“There are a load of MPs I thought I’d be spending decades with in this place,” said another. “They’re really good mates. And almost all of them are gone. It’s a reminder of how vulnerable we all are.”And here’s one of the few remaining members of the Conservatives’ vast 2019 intake: “It’s not great to feel like a greybeard when you’ve only been here four-and-a-half years.”It’s in that emotional state that the remaining MPs need to start answering questions about where to go next. But they are in no hurry to do so. Indeed it’s hard even to know what the right questions are.Most glaring and immediate, of course, is the question of who should succeed Rishi Sunak. The fact that no-one has yet declared their candidacy - and there appears to be no particular clamour for them to do so - tells its own story.As one shadow cabinet minister put it: “Look at 1997 and look at 2005 - 2005 was a lot longer and went a lot better.”In 1997, the last time the Conservatives were ejected from government, John Major was replaced by William Hague within 49 days. In 2005, it took seven months for David Cameron to be chosen to replace Michael Howard. Lord Hague’s four years as leader were forlorn, Lord Cameron led the Conservatives back into government.“The question I hear people asking each other the most,” one Conservative MP said, “is who is our David Cameron?”In some quarters, the drift towards a longer leadership election betrays a lack of enthusiasm for the likely candidates.One influential backbencher suggested that postponing the start of the contest would allow MPs to see how the putative candidates take to the task of opposition, for example responding in the King’s Speech debate or tabling urgent questions to cabinet ministers.For others, though, a long campaign is an opportunity to have a more fundamental debate about how the Conservatives should rebuild.“The problem is we lost votes everywhere at once,” one MP on the right of the party said. “Lots want us to just think about the challenge from Reform, and we must, but we can’t ignore our other former voters.”Consider a couple of constituencies for a moment. ', 'After the 2019 general election, Boston and Skegness was the second-safest Conservative seat in the country. The party won 76.7% of the vote with Labour limping in second on 15.2%. Last week Reform UK claimed the seat, even though the Labour vote stayed roughly the same. If every Conservative loss were like that, the party’s clear incentive would be to focus relentlessly on those voters they lost to Reform.But then look at Stratford-on-Avon. At the 2019 election the Conservatives won this seat with 60.6% of the vote, way ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 24.3%. Last week, the Liberal Democrats won the seat, the first time anyone but a Conservative had won there since 1906. Yet the Conservative vote collapsed in more than one direction. Lots of votes were lost to the Liberal Democrats but Reform claimed 14.6% of the vote too. If those votes had gone to the Conservatives, the party would have just clung on to the seat.', ""That’s before you even get on to all the seats where Conservative voters defected in large numbers to Labour.But it’s far from straightforward to assume that Reform votes would have just flowed to the Conservatives without Nigel Farage’s involvement.“Most Reform voters don’t like the Conservative Party,” says Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester. “They courted them for two years and it did nothing.“Conservatives assume that because most Reform voters backed the Tories in 2019 that they are low-hanging fruit, easy to win back. But this doesn’t follow. They feel let down by the Conservative Party, and just saying nice things to them isn’t going to cut it for them. Even if you can get some of them back you will lose others in doing so.”Even those MPs who think the Conservatives need to prioritise the Reform UK vote admit there is uncertainty about what’s behind the party's surge.“The big question about Reform is whether it’s just about immigration,” one MP on the right of the party said, “or whether it’s also about economics and trust. Some of us think it’s something much bigger, a bit like a Marine Le Pen moment.“If we’re right, then it’s no good just pitching for Reform votes by going harder and harder on immigration, because you can never satisfy enough of them, and with some of them you wouldn’t want to. And in the meantime you’re turning off Lib Dems.”"", 'Another Conservative said: “The answer is we need to find a way to appeal to voters we lost to all parties. I don’t know how you do that on policy, but Keir Starmer showed you can do it by looking competent and serious. But I don’t know if any of the candidates we have at the moment can do that.”Others worry, though, that a long leadership contest will allow Labour to develop new arguments about their inheritance in government from the Conservatives, with the Conservative Party too distracted by internal wrangling to hit back.“The only vulnerability Labour will leave us is on small boats - they really don’t have a plan,” one said. “But we won’t be able to beat them on that because of our record. So that leaves space for Reform.”In opposition, though, the matter of attacking the government is mechanical as much as it is about narrative and policy.And the stark reality of the Conservatives’ depleted ranks is that they are going to find it hard to be an effective opposition. There are likely to be somewhere between 80 and 90 government ministers to shadow. Appoint a shadow frontbencher to correspond to each one and you’re left with only about 30 backbenchers out of 121 MPs. That’s before two deputy speakers.“I guess we’re going to have to pick and choose which jobs we really want to shadow,” one current shadow minister said. “There’s going to be lots of doubling up. I don’t know how that will all work.”From the existential to the mundane - that’s the range of questions a traumatised Conservative Party now has to consider. And they don’t all think they will get it right.“If there’s one thing this campaign has taught me,” one Conservative official said, “it’s that things can always get worse.”', 'BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.
