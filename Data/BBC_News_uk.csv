Biden calls for ban on gun used to shoot Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1x4xjvrgdo#0,"The US president resumes his campaign with criticism of Donald Trump and says the weapon used against him should be ""outlawed"".","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 13:46:13 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.585165,"[""Joe Biden has renewed a call for Congress to ban assault rifles, including the model that was used in the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Trump's ear was grazed by a bullet after a gunman shot at him from a nearby rooftop during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.“An AR-15 was used in the shooting of Donald Trump. This was the assault weapon that killed so many others, including children. It’s time to outlaw them,” Mr Biden told the audience at a convention in Las Vegas.His demand came as he returned to the campaign trail for the first time since the attack. "", ""Biden urges America to 'lower temperature' after Trump shootingIn maps: Donald Trump assassination attempt"", 'For several days following the shooting, the Biden campaign had been on pause. Verbal attacks had been halted, television ads pulled and a message of unity was pushed by many prominent Democrats.Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Biden continued in that vein, lamenting how “heated” politics has become. But later in his speech - an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP), a prominent civil rights group - he went on to roundly criticise Trump.“Just because our politics are very divided doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth. Who you are, what you’ve done, what you will do - that’s fair game,” he said.""Let me say it again because Trump is lying like hell about it,” he told the conference hall of primarily black voters. “Black unemployment hit a record low under the Biden-Harris administration,"" the president added. Statistics show that his government reached the record low unemployment rate for Black or African Americans in 2023, at 4.8%.Gun rights are an issue Mr Biden has frequently campaigned on.In 1994, he was instrumental in passing an assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004. He referenced that legislation during his speech, saying ""I\'ve done it before, I\'ll do it again"". In 2022, during his first term as president, Mr Biden signed into law the most significant gun safety legislation in more than two decades, which included enhanced background checks for gun buyers and other protections.But he has repeatedly come up against strong opposition from Republicans to an assault weapons ban.The president\'s return to the campaign trail came as the Republican National Convention (RNC) closed out its second day on Tuesday, with a line-up of speakers - including former presidential nominee rivals Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis - roundly uniting behind Trump.At a side event hosted by the gun rights group, US Concealed Carry Association, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign said Donald Trump would safeguard gun rights by appointing pro-gun judges if he is elected in November.""We\'ll see a continuation of supporting and defending the Second Amendment, and really where that comes into play is the judiciary,"" Chris LaCivita told attendees, according to Reuters news agency.Donald Trump has already said that he would unravel all of Mr Biden’s new gun rules if elected in November, a stance that shows no sign of changing even following Saturday’s attempt on his life.Authorities are yet to land on the motive of gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was able to shoot at Trump after climbing onto the roof of a building 130m (426ft) from where he was speaking.An independent review of the Secret Service’s handling of the shooting is underway and Republican leaders in Congress have also announced an investigation.']"
Cyanide found in blood of Bangkok hotel victims,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g64ljwp2go#0,Police suspect that one of the dead was behind the poisoning and was driven by crushing debt.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 14:21:38 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.585437,"['Cyanide has been found in the blood of all six people who died in a luxury hotel suite in Bangkok, say doctors after examining their bodies.Based on the initial post-mortem examination, they say there is ""no other cause"" that would explain their deaths ""except for cyanide"". But further tests are being carried out to determine the ""intensity"" of the deadly chemical and to rule out any other toxins.Forensic investigators had earlier found traces of cyanide on the teacups used by the victims, all of whom are of Vietnamese origin including two with dual US citizenship. Police suspect that one of the dead was behind the poisoning and was driven by crushing debt - but have not said who.The victims\' lips and nails had turned dark purple indicating a lack of oxygen, while their internal organs turned ""blood red"", which is another sign of cyanide poisoning, said Professor Kornkiat Vongpaisarnsin of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Chulalongkorn University.Doctor Chanchai Sittipunt, the dean of the Faculty of Medicine, said they still needed to find out how much cyanide was in the blood of the deceased.""But from what we have detected - from observation, from internal organ check, from finding cyanide in the blood during the screening test - there is no other cause that would be the factor that would cause their deaths, except for cyanide,” he told reporters.The deceased were found by housekeepers at the Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel in the Thai capital late on Tuesday.Investigators believe they had been dead for between 12 and 24 hours by then. The mystery around the shocking discovery made international headlines. Thailand\'s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin ordered an urgent investigation into the case, stressing that the deaths were the result of a ""private matter"", and there was no suggestion of public danger. Police have since begun to piece together what might have happened. Two of the six victims had loaned ""tens of millions of Thai baht"" to another of the deceased for investment purposes, authorities said. Ten million baht is worth nearly $280,000 (£215,000).', 'Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Bangkok police chief Gen Noppassin Poonsawat told a press conference the group checked into the hotel separately over the weekend and were assigned five rooms - four on the seventh floor, and one on the fifth. They had been scheduled to check out on Monday but failed to do so.Four of the victims are Vietnamese nationals Thi Nguyen Phuong, 46, her husband Hong Pham Thanh, 49, Thi Nguyen Phuong Lan, 47,  and Dinh Tran Phu, 37.The other two are American citizens Sherine Chong, 56, and Dang Hung Van, 55.The US state department has offered its condolences and said it is ""closely monitoring"" the situation. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting Thai authorities in the investigation, Mr Srettha said.', 'The motive is not clear, but police said two of the six had loaned a substantial amount of money to another person in the group, who had not been paid back.Police say on Monday afternoon all six victims gathered in the room on the fifth floor. The group ordered food and tea, which was delivered to the room around 14:00 local time (08:00 BST) and received by Ms Chong - who was the only person in the room at the time. According to the deputy police chief, a waiter offered to make tea for the guests but Ms Chong refused this. The waiter recalled that she “spoke very little and was visibly under stress”, authorities said.The waiter later left the room. The rest of the group then began streaming into the room at various points, between 14:03 and 14:17. No one else is believed to have entered the room apart from the six inside and police have said the door to the room was locked from within. ', 'Police say there were no signs of a struggle, robbery or forced entry. They later found traces of cyanide in all six tea cups.Pictures released by the police show plates of untouched food left on a table in the room, some of them still covered in cling wrap. There was a seventh name on the group\'s hotel booking, whom police identified as the younger sister of one of the victims. She had left Thailand last week for the Vietnamese coastal city of Da Nang and is not involved in the incident, police said. Relatives interviewed by the police said Thi Nguyen Phuong and Hong Pham Thanh, a couple, owned a road construction business and had given money to Ms Chong to invest in a hospital building project in Japan.Police suspect that Mr Tran, a make-up artist based in Da Nang, had also been “duped"" into making an investment. Mr Tran\'s mother Tuý told BBC Vietnamese that he had travelled to Thailand on Friday and had called home on Sunday to say he had to extend his stay until Monday. That was the last his family had heard from him. She rang him again on Monday but he did not answer the call. Ms Chong had hired Mr Tran as her personal make-up artist for the trip, one of his students told BBC Vietnamese. Mr Tran\'s father, Phu, told Vietnamese media that his son was hired last week by a Vietnamese woman to travel to Thailand.  The six bodies were discovered one day after Thailand expanded its visa-free entry scheme to travellers from 93 countries and territories to revitalise its tourism industry. ', ""Cyanide is a rapidly-acting, highly toxic chemical that is potentially deadly. Low levels of cyanide occur in nature and in products we eat and use. But in larger doses it is a notorious poison, and has been used as a chemical warfare agent because of its fast-acting and highly lethal properties.It can occur as a colourless gas or liquid or in crystal form. People can be exposed to cyanide by breathing it in, absorbing it through the skin, or eating food or liquids that contain it.When consumed in large amounts, cyanide can lead to lung injury, coma and death within seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Even in smaller doses, cyanide is still very harmful, causing chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath and vomiting.Cyanide can produce a “bitter almond” smell but not everyone can detect this and it doesn’t always give off an odour.Additional reporting by BBC Thai and BBC Vietnamese's Thuong Le""]"
"Hamas committed war crimes on 7 October, says Human Rights Watch",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vdz75g6dvo#0,"Hamas rejects what it calls the ""lies"" in HRW's report about the deadly attack on Israel that it led.","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:44:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.585644,"[""Hamas and at least four other Palestinian armed groups committed numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity against civilians during the 7 October attack on southern Israel, the campaign group Human Rights Watch says.A new report accuses the hundreds of gunmen who breached the Gaza border fence of violations including deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, wilful killing of persons in custody, sexual and gender-based violence, hostage-taking, mutilation of bodies and looting.It also found the killing of civilians and hostage-taking were “central aims of the planned attack” and not an “afterthought”.Hamas angrily rejected what it called HRW’s “lies” and demanded an apology.About 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others were taken as hostages when 26 Israeli communities and towns, as well as number of military bases, two music festivals and a beach party were attacked nine months ago.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza with the aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages.More than 38,790 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.HRW's report does not cover alleged violations of the laws of war by Israeli forces and Palestinian groups in the conflict that was triggered by the 7 October attack."", 'The report released by HRW on Wednesday is based on interviews with 144 people, including witnesses to the 7 October attack, as well as analysis of more than 280 photographs and videos posted on social media or shared with the group’s researchers.“Across many attack sites, [Palestinian] fighters fired directly at civilians, often at close range, as they tried to flee, and at people who happened to be driving vehicles in the area,” it says.“They hurled grenades and shot into safe rooms and other shelters and fired rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) at homes. They set some houses on fire, burning and suffocating people to death, and forcing out others who they then captured or killed,” it adds.“They took hundreds hostage for transfer to Gaza or summarily killed them.”Hamas’s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, led the assault, but HRW says it has strong evidence of the participation of at least four other Palestinian armed groups, based on headbands the gunmen wore and their claims posted on social media:al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)Omar al-Qasim Forces, the armed wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, the armed wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, which is linked to the Fatah movementThe BBC has previously reported that they took part in military-style exercises with Hamas from 2020 onwards which closely resembled the tactics used on 7 October. ', 'HRW’s report concludes that the Palestinian groups committed a widespread and systematic attack directed against a civilian population, which amounts to a crime against humanity, based on the numerous civilian sites that were targeted and “the planning that went into the crimes”.It also found that the killing of civilians and the taking of hostages were “all central aims of the planned attack, and not actions that occurred as an afterthought, or as a plan gone awry, or as isolated acts, for example solely by the actions of unaffiliated Palestinians from Gaza, and as such, there is strong evidence of an organisational policy to commit multiple acts of crimes against humanity”.The report says further investigation is needed into other potential crimes against humanity, including persecution against any identifiable group on racial, national, ethnic or religious grounds; rape or sexual violence of comparable gravity; and extermination, if there was a mass killing calculated to bring about the “destruction” of part of a population.The report includes a letter from Hamas responding to the allegations, in which the group said it was “committed to respecting international law” and that the al-Qassam Brigades “was clear in directing its members and fighters not to target civilians”.Hamas also said the participation of unaffiliated Palestinians from Gaza and other armed groups not involved in the initial, planned assault led to “chaos in the field”, a change in “the plan to conduct an operation against military targets” and “the occurrence of many mistakes”.The report says HRW found Hamas’s claim that its forces did not seek to harm Israeli civilians was “false”, noting that photos and videos showed gunmen seeking out civilians and killing them at various sites from the first moments of the attack.In a statement issued following the report’s publication, Hamas said: “We reject the lies and blatant bias towards the occupation [Israel] and the lack of professionalism and credibility in the Human Rights Watch report. We demand its withdrawal and an apology.”In a separate report in April, HRW said an Israeli air strike on a residential building in central Gaza on 31 October that killed 106 people constituted a war crime. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and accuses Hamas of operating in civilian structures.The group has also accused the Israeli government of using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, which is a war crime. Israel says it facilitates deliveries of humanitarian aid and is not to blame for Gaza’s food shortages.In May, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) applied for arrest warrants for Hamas’s Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, military chief Mohammed Deif and political leader Ismail Haniyeh for crimes against humanity and war crimes from 7 October onwards. He also sought warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Both Hamas and Israel reacted with outrage to the announcement.']"

The original is kept in the nearby Bargello museum.The photos sparked angry reactions from social media users, some of whom called for the woman\'s arrest.""This is the result of years of attempts at turning Florence into Disneyland,"" said another.Patrizia Asproni, the president of Confcultura, an association that promotes Italy\'s cultural heritage, told Italian media that these ""repeated shows of rudeness and barbarity"" take place ""because everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want with impunity"".Ms Asproni called for the application of the ""Singapore model"" with ""tight checks, sky-high fines and zero tolerance"" for bad behaviour.Antonella Rinaldi, Florence\'s archaeology and fine arts superintendent, said: ""Tourists are welcome here but they need to respect our artworks, be they originals or replicas.""""Although I doubt this lady - whom I condemn - even knows the difference,"" she added.Florence is one of the world\'s foremost tourist destinations. In 2023, around 1.5 million people visited the city - which has a population of just 382,000 - between June and September.Local residents have long struggled with the huge influx of tourists, which in the summer months turns Florence\'s narrow streets into steady streams of people. The so-called ""overtourism"" phenomenon has prompted several cities around the world to make changes to the way they welcome tourists. Last month, the mayor of Barcelona pledged to eliminate short-term tourist lets in the city within five years, while several hotspots - like Venice or Japan\'s Mount Fuji - have started to introduce daily charges to try to limit numbers.']"
Trump's defeated Republican rivals show united front at convention,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd0gn6nel6o#0,"Several of the former president's past challengers, including Nikki Haley, voiced full support for his candidacy.","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 03:56:22 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.586038,"['One by one, Donald Trump’s defeated rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination took the stage to sing his praises at the party\'s convention on Tuesday night.From his box just above the convention floor, Trump smiled at times as he watched his former opponents Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy voice their full support for his candidacy.If there were any doubts that this was Trump’s party, Tuesday’s programming put them to rest.“I’ll start by making one thing perfectly clear: Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,” said Ms Haley, the former UN Ambassador who posed the strongest challenge to Trump earlier this year.She said Trump had asked her to speak at the event in Milwaukee in the name of “unity"".“For the sake of our nation we have to go with Donald Trump,” she told the crowd.Ms Haley said in May that she would vote for the former president, but her headline speech on Tuesday was her most direct endorsement of the Republican nominee yet.And when she declared her endorsement, Trump stood and clapped.Ms Haley’s arrival, however, was not universally welcomed in the arena. There was a noticeable intake of breath as she acknowledged that she and Trump had their differences.Some Republicans have struggled to forgive her for launching an aggressive campaign against their favoured candidate. Late in the race, she questioned whether Trump had the mental stamina to serve as president.A smattering of boos greeted her as she took the podium, though they were soon drowned out by cheers and chants.She deserves the booing, said Gregory Switzer, a conservative activist from Texas.“She stayed in that race a lot longer than she needed to and dragged out the inevitable,"" said Matt Bumela, a delegate from Washington state who had predicted the booing. “And said things about Trump that were negative all the way up to the end.”', 'Ms Haley notably broke from Trump when she called for the US to continue to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.When she later said she would vote for him in November, she said the former president would be “smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me"".On Tuesday night, she told supporters of hers who might be on the fence: “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him – take it from me.”“Tonight is our unity night,” said New Hampshire state Senator William Gannon, who had served as a delegate for Ms Haley. He believed Trump made the right choice to invite her to speak.“I wanna win the national election,” he said. “It was a wise move to bring her in.”The third-place finisher in the primary, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, received a far more enthusiastic welcome from the crowd.He touched on several conservative social issues, including diversity initiatives, which he said were “indoctrination”.He urged the crowd to rally behind Trump – though they were already solidly behind their current nominee. “We cannot let him down, and we cannot let America down,” Mr DeSantis said.He also took a swipe at Mr Biden’s age, an issue that is currently roiling the Democratic Party. “We need a commander-in-chief who can lead 24 hours a day and seven days a week,” he said.Daniel Willis, the 25-year-old chair of the Delaware Young Republicans, said Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley did more than enough “to bridge the gap” with Trump supporters.LISTEN: Americast discusses the Republican rivals reunitedLara Trump, Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, hit a conciliatory tone, telling the crowd: “You don’t have to admit that you like everything that he tweets, but Americans were better off when he was in office.”She added: “Last Saturday reminded us that we Americans must remember that there is more that unites us than divides us.""The rest of the night was devoted to the more common Republican campaign points, such as migrant crossings at the border, crime and an overarching commitment to defeating Mr Biden.Ted Cruz, the US senator from Texas, said there was a “literal invasion” of the United States. Dr Ben Carson, who served in Trump\'s cabinet, accused Democrats of “shredding the Constitution"".Trump himself led a huge standing ovation for Madeline Brame, a woman whose son was killed in New York in 2018 and has since called for tough-on-crime policies.Down on the floor, delegates said they were ready to move beyond the intra-party divisions of the primary and instead focus the party’s energy on President Biden.“At the end of the day,” said Georgia delegate Pam Lightsey, “We’re all Republicans.”']"
Ex-CIA analyst charged with spying for South Korea,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5qd82pjlo#0,"Sue Mi Terry is accused of helping South Korea in exchange for cash, luxury bags, fancy meals and expensive clothes.

Sue Mi Terry, who previously worked as a senior official for the White House National Security Council, faces two counts of failing to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Federal officials say Ms Terry - a prominent US expert on North Korea - acted as an agent for the South Korean government for over a decade, but she did not register as a foreign agent with American officials, according to court documents made public on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York.The Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank where Ms Terry works as a senior fellow on Asia, has placed her on unpaid leave, a spokesperson told US outlets. The organisation has also removed her biography from its website. Ms Terry, 54, denies the charges and her attorney, Lee Wolosky, told the BBC the allegations against her were ""unfounded"".The charges ""distort the work of a scholar and news analyst known for her independence and years of service to the United States"", Mr Wolosky said. ""In fact, she was a harsh critic of the South Korean government during times this indictment alleges that she was acting on its behalf.""Born in South Korea, Ms Terry moved to the US at age 12, according to her previous employer at Columbia University. In 2001, she earned her doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, a prominent international relations school in Massachusetts. She is known to lecture in English and Korean.Ms Terry, 54, then went on to work as a senior analyst for the CIA from 2001 to 2008, before holding a variety of posts in the federal government, including as Director for Korea, Japan, and Oceanic Affairs at the National Security Council during the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Prosecutors say Ms Terry\'s work as an agent for the South Korean government began in 2013, about five years, after she stopped working for the CIA and the National Security Council. In the 31-page indictment, officials say Ms Terry admitted to FBI agents in a voluntary interview in 2023 that she was a “source” for South Korea’s National Intelligence Service. The indictment alleges that the South Korean government gifted Ms Terry a $2,845 (£2,100) Dolce & Gabbana coat, a $3,450 Louis Vuitton handbag and meals at upscale restaurants.Officials say the government also gave her $37,000 and came up with a plan to hide the source of the funds, ultimately placing them in a gift fund at the think tank where she worked. Ms Terry\'s indictment comes just a day after Democratic Senator Robert Menendez was convicted of helping foreign governments in exchange for luxury items including gold bars and a Mercedes car. ']"

Since losing her appeal against the ban, she has thrown her weight behind Edmundo González and campaigned on his behalf, criss-crossing the country and encouraging voters to unite behind him in order to defeat Mr Maduro at the polls. Dozens of members of her campaign team have been arrested, with some accused of involvement in anti-government conspiracies. ', 'Restaurant and food stall owners have also complained about their businesses being closed down by officials after they served the opposition leaders.The government alleges that the businesses were shuttered because their paperwork was not in order.The non-governmental organisation Foro Penal, which keeps a tally of what it says are political prisoners, said more than 100 people linked to the opposition had been detained in the run-up to the presidential election.Foro Penal said that the high number of arrests was a clear indication of  ""a systematic scheme"" to restrict the rights of Venezuelan citizens.Opinion polls give Edmundo González a huge lead over President Maduro, but many in the opposition fear the election result may be tampered with.The 2018 election in which Mr Maduro was re-elected to a second term was widely dismissed as being neither free nor fair. The opposition coalition led by Ms Machado is urging its supporters to turn out to vote despite these concerns, arguing that overwhelming support for their unity candidate will make it harder for any fraud to take place.']"
Trump's choice of running mate raises fears in Ukraine and EU,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727zvgvv8ko#1,Diplomats and politicians voice concern over JD Vance's repeated criticism of US aid to Ukraine.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 19:44:20 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.586730,"['European politicians and diplomats had already prepared for changes to their relationship with the US in the event of a second Donald Trump presidency.Now that the Republican candidate has chosen Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, those differences appear even more stark on prospects for the war in Ukraine, security and trade.A vocal critic of US aid to Ukraine, Mr Vance told this year’s Munich Security Conference that Europe should wake up to the US having to “pivot” its focus to East Asia. ""The American security blanket has allowed European security to atrophy,"" he said.Nils Schmid, a senior MP in German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s party, told the BBC that he was confident a Republican presidency would continue to stay within Nato, even if JD Vance came across as ""more isolationist"" and Donald Trump remained ""unpredictable"".However, he warned of a new round of ""trade wars"" with the US under a second Trump presidency.An EU diplomat said that after four years of Donald Trump no-one was naïve: ""We understand what it means if Trump comes back as a second-term president, regardless of his running mate.""Portraying the EU as a sailing boat preparing for a storm the diplomat, who preferred not to be named, added that whatever they might be able to tie down, it was always going to be rough.The US is Ukraine\'s biggest ally, and President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week: ""I\'m not afraid about him becoming president, we will work together.""', 'He also said that he believed most of the Republican party supported Ukraine and its people.Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump also have a common friend in Boris Johnson, the former UK prime minister, who has consistently championed continued aid for Ukraine and recently met the former president at the Republican National Convention.Following the meeting, Mr Johnson posted on X that he had “no doubt that [Mr Trump] will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy”.But even if that sentiment is true, it might not apply to Mr Vance, who, days before the full-scale invasion, told a podcast he “doesn’t really care what happens in Ukraine, one way or the other”. He also played a key role in delaying a $60bn military aid package from Washington.""We need to try and convince him otherwise,"" says Yevhen Mahda, the Executive Director of the Institute of World Policy think tank in Kyiv.""A fact we can use is that he fought in Iraq, therefore he should be invited to Ukraine so he can see with his own eyes what is happening and how American money is spent.""The question for Kyiv will be to what extent he can influence the decisions of his new boss.Yevhen Mahda agrees that Trump’s unpredictability could be a problem for Kyiv in the run-up to the US presidential election.The biggest supporter of the Trump-Vance ticket in the European Union is Hungary’s Viktor Orban who returned recently from a visit to see the Republican candidate, after visiting Mr Zelensky and President Putin, with whom he maintains close ties.In a letter to EU leaders, Mr Orban said a victorious Donald Trump would not even wait to be inaugurated as president before quickly demanding peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.', '""He has detailed and well-founded plans for this,"" the letter states.Mr Zelensky has himself said this week that Russia should attend a peace summit possibly next November, and he has promised a “fully ready plan”. But he made clear he had not come under Western pressure to do so.Viktor Orban\'s recent ""peace missions"" to Moscow and Beijing have sparked accusations that he’s abusing his country’s six-month rotating presidency of the European Council. European Commission officials have been told not to attend meetings in Hungary because of Mr Orban’s actions.During the Trump presidency, the US imposed tariffs on EU-produced steel and aluminium. Although they were paused under Joe Biden’s administration, Trump has since floated a 10% tariff on all overseas imports should he get back into the White House.The prospect of renewed economic confrontation with the US will be seen as a bad, even a disastrous, outcome in most European capitals.""The only thing we know for sure is there will be punitive tariffs levelled on the European Union so we have to prepare for another round of trade wars,"" said Nils Schmid, the Social Democrats’ foreign policy lead in the Bundestag.JD Vance singled out Berlin for criticism of its military preparedness earlier this year.While he didn’t mean to ""beat up"" on Germany, he said the industrial base underpinning its arms production was  insufficient.', 'This will all pile further pressure on Germany, Europe’s largest economy, to ""step up"" as a principal player in underwriting European security.After his much-lauded ""zeitenwende"" (turning point) speech in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Olaf Scholz was often accused of hesitancy on supplying weapons to Kyiv.But his allies are always keen to point out that Germany is second only to the US in terms of military aid to Kyiv while it has – for the first time since the end of the Cold War – met the 2% GDP defence spending target, albeit via short-term budgeting.""I think we are on the right track,"" said Mr Schmid. ""We have to build back an army that was neglected for 15 to 20 years.""But observers are far from convinced that behind-the-scenes European preparations are either serious or sufficient.There are few leaders with the political clout or inclination to champion the future security architecture of an unwieldy European continent.Chancellor Scholz has an understated style and clear resistance to taking a lead on bolder foreign policy positions – and faces a very real prospect of being voted out of office next year.French President Emmanuel Macron has been left a severely weakened figure after calling parliamentary elections that have left his country in a state of political paralysis.Polish President Andrzej Duda warned on Tuesday that if Ukraine loses its struggle against Russia “then Russia’s potential war with the West will be extremely imminent”.""This voracious Russian monster will want to attack on and on.""']"

Around 30 students ate the fiery snacks after one of them brought them to school on Tuesday, Japanese local media reported. Soon, some of them started complaining of nausea and acute pain around their mouth, prompting emergency calls to the fire department and police.The 13 girls and one boy who were taken to hospital were conscious and reportedly  had minor symptoms.The company that makes the snack, Isoyama Corp, put out a statement, apologising for ""any inconvenience"" to customers, and wished the students a swift recovery. The school and the company have not responded to the BBC\'s questions so far. The company website is full of warnings for those who may wish to try the crisps. It ""forbids"" those under 18 from consuming the crisps which are called  ""R 18+ curry chips"", because of how spicy they are - and it warns even those who love hot food to ""eat with caution"". The crisps are ""so spicy that they may cause you pain"", it says. The spiciness comes from the potent “ghost pepper”, cultivated in northeastern India, where it\'s known as bhut jolokia. Although it is used in recipes in India and elsewhere, it\'s known to be among the world\'s hottest chillis. The kick from your chilli can have side effectsThe Japanese firm, in fact, advises people not to ""eat the chips when they are alone” and says they could cause diarrhoea if eaten ""excessively"". Those with high blood pressure and weak stomachs ""are absolutely prohibited"" from eating the crisps, according to the company\'s website. It warns people who have cuts on their fingers to be careful while opening the packets. Those who are ""timid or too scared"" are also discouraged from trying the snack.One media report said one of the students, a boy, brought the crisps to school ""just for fun"".Responding to news about the hospitalisations, some X users posted a ""spicy meter"" to demonstrate how hot the crisps were, while others shared videos of their agonising experience of eating them. In one video, a user who appears to be wincing, described it as ""painful"" and said it reminded him of the time he had urinary stones.X owner Elon Musk also weighed in, saying ""they must be next-level spicy!""']"

And we’re going to win.”Mr Kennedy then says: “Yeah.”Trump and Mr Kennedy, a longshot third-party candidate, are political rivals who have occasionally criticised each other during the campaign.The footage is said to have been recorded on Sunday, a day before the pair met in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Republican convention is taking place, stoking speculation that Mr Kennedy might be about to exit the race and endorse Trump.But Kennedy spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said on Monday that he was not dropping out.Robert F Kennedy Jr posted on X on Tuesday: “When President Trump called me I was taping with an in-house videographer.“I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately.

Indian man stuck in lift for 42 hours thought he would die,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngwv59wq4o#1,Ravindran Nair entered a hospital lift on Saturday afternoon. He was rescued on Monday morning.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:36:15 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.588014,"['A man from the southern Indian state of Kerala, who got trapped in a hospital lift for 42 hours without any food or water, has told the BBC he feared he would die there.Ravindran Nair, 59, entered the lift to meet a doctor on Saturday afternoon - he then remained stuck inside until Monday morning, when a lift operator found him. He is now in hospital and is being treated for dehydration and back pain. His family members initially thought he was at work, but later contacted police and began a desperate search for him.The incident has made headlines, prompting the state government to suspend three technicians and launch an inquiry. Officials from the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, and the state\'s health minister have apologised to Mr Nair.Mr Nair told the BBC that when he got trapped, he tried calling the emergency number listed in the lift but there was no response. He also tried calling his wife Sreelekha CP, who works at the hospital, and ""anyone else I could think of"", but the calls wouldn\'t connect.""I began panicking and started banging on the lift doors to attract attention. That’s when my phone fell on the floor and stopped working,"" he says.""I shouted and screamed for help and tried pulling apart the doors with my hands. It was now dark inside the lift, but thankfully, there was sufficient air to breathe.""He then paced around the lift, pressing the alarm bell again and again, hoping it would ring and catch someone\'s attention - but without any success. ""As the hours passed, I had no idea whether it was day or night as it was pitch dark inside. When I got tired, I slept in a corner. I had to use another corner to pee and poo,"" he says.', 'Mr Nair said he began visiting the hospital regularly a few months ago after he fell in the bathroom and started suffering from back pain.""On Saturday, my wife and I went to meet the doctor and I got an X-ray scan done of my back because I was experiencing severe pain after a recent trip,"" he recalls. When the doctor asked to see the results from his blood test, the couple realised that they had forgotten them at home. Since Ms Sreelakha had to report for work, Mr Nair went home to pick up the results. Normally when he visits the hospital he and his wife use a lift earmarked for employees. But this time he stepped into Lift-11 - meant for patients and visitors - to head up to the second floor. ""It was just past noon then. There was no-one else in the lift but the light was on, so I didn\'t think anything was wrong,"" he says.He pressed the button and the lift began ascending but as it neared the second floor, it lurched downwards with a thud and got stuck between the first and second floors.He didn\'t know then that his ordeal would last nearly two days. At some point he remembered he had to take pills to keep his blood pressure under control. ""I had them on me, but couldn’t swallow them because I had no water and my mouth was dry from shouting for help,"" he recalls.""I started wondering whether I would die inside the lift. I worried about my wife and children and thought about my late parents and ancestors. But then, I somehow willed myself to be stronger and told myself that I had to overcome this frightening ordeal.""One thing that gave him comfort, he says, was reciting poems written by his wife. ""I held on to the hope that someone would come along to repair the lift and find me there.""Help arrived finally on Monday morning at around 06:00 local time when an operator opened the door and asked him to jump out - 42 hours after his ordeal began.Once Mr Nair was rescued, the first thing he did was call his wife, who had no idea her missing husband was trapped at her workplace.""He wanted me to come and take him home,"" she says.The hospital has since put up a warning outside the lift asking people not to use it while it is being repaired.']"

If this conflict escalates to all-out war, it could dwarf the destruction in Gaza, draw in Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, spread embers around the Middle East and embroil the US. Iran itself could intervene directly.The United Nations has warned of a “catastrophe beyond imagination”.For now, a low-level war simmers in the summer heat, along a 120km (75 mile) stretch of border. One spark here could set the Middle East alight.', 'Over the lapping of the waves, and the thwack thwack of paddle games on the beach, a sound cuts through - a sudden deep boom.Soon smoke billows from a hillside in the distance after an Israeli strike.Around the pool in a resort hotel, a few sunbathers stand briefly to scan the horizon.Others don’t move a tanned limb.Explosions are part of the sound of summer 2024 in the ancient Lebanese city of Tyre, as Hezbollah and Israel exchange fire across the border 25 kilometres (15 miles) away.“Another day, another bomb,” says Roland, 49, with a shrug, as he relaxes on a lilo. He lives abroad but is back home on holiday.“We got used to it somehow over the months,” says his friend Mustafa, 39, “though children are still a little bit scared.” He nods towards his daughter Miral, 7, who is dripping wet from the pool.“When she hears an explosion, she always asks, ‘will there be a bomb now?’” he says.', 'Earlier this month, there was a massive blast in his neighbourhood in Tyre, as his family of four were having a meal. Israel had assassinated a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Nimah Nasser.“We heard the noise,” Mustafa says, “and we carried on eating.”But the sunbathers on the beach in Tyre may be on borrowed time. This city will be in the firing line in the event of all-out war, along with the rest of southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah stronghold.We are now at the water’s edge of a potentially devastating war which both sides say they don’t want. Iran doesn’t seem to want it either.How did we get here?', 'On October 8th last year – one day after Hamas gunmen stormed out of Gaza and killed about 1,200 Israelis as well as taking 251 others hostage – Hezbollah joined in, firing at Israeli targets from Lebanon.The Shia Islamist armed group said it was acting in support of Gaza.Soon Israel was firing back.Hezbollah, which is also a political party, is the most powerful force in Lebanon.Like Hamas, it is classed as a terrorist organisation by many countries, including the UK and the US.But unlike Hamas, Hezbollah has the firepower to seriously threaten Israel.It is believed to have an arsenal of more than 150,000 rockets and missiles - some precision-guided - capable of inflicting heavy damage around the country.What is Hezbollah in Lebanon and will it go to war with Israel?Put simply Hezbollah - its English translation, the Party of God - has more arms than many countries.Its backer Iran – which denies Israel’s right to exist – is happy to train and fund the enemies of the Jewish state.The conflict has been heating up, with thousands of cross-border strikes.Some countries have already told their nationals to leave Lebanon urgently, including Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and Saudi Arabia. The UK has advised against all travel to the country and is urging Britons who are here to leave - while they still can.So far, both sides are mainly striking military targets, close to the border -  staying within familiar red lines.', 'But here on the Lebanese side, we have seen destruction in civilian areas with scorched fields, flattened houses and abandoned villages.And the current tit-for-tat has already driven tens of thousands from their homes - more than 90,000 in Lebanon and about 60,000 in Israel.Israeli officials say 33 people have been killed so far in Hezbollah attacks, mostly soldiers.Lebanon’s losses are far higher at 466, according to the Ministry of Health here. Most of the dead were fighters.Sally Skaiki was not.', '“I never called her Sally,” says her father Hussein Abdul Hassan Skaiki. “I always called her ‘my life’ - she was everything for me.”“She was the only girl in the house, and we spoiled her, me and her three brothers.”Sally, 25, was a volunteer paramedic. She was killed by an Israeli strike after sunset on 14 June as she stood in the doorway of her building.Her father wears the black of mourning, and the green scarf of the Shia Amal movement, which is allied to Hezbollah.', 'We meet in his village of Deir Qanoun En-Naher, 30km (18 miles) from the border. The main road is dotted with sun-bleached posters of fighters killed in battle against Israel - some in recent months, others back in 2006 when the two sides last went to war.In that conflict, Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill but at huge cost to Lebanon and its people. There was massive destruction, and more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians were killed - according to official figures - along with an unconfirmed number of Hezbollah fighters.Israel’s death toll was 160, according to the government, most of them soldiers.By Hussein’s side there is a large poster of Sally, in her headscarf and paramedic uniform. He speaks of his daughter with pride and with anguish.“She loved to help people,” he says. “Any problem that happened, she rushed there. She was well-loved in the village. She always had a smile on her face.”As we speak there is a loud boom which rattles the windows.Hussein says it is a normal, daily occurrence.“Since a long time, Israel killed our people here,” he says.“We can’t forgive them. There is no hope of peace with them.”This time, there is no death or destruction. Instead, Israeli warplanes are breaking the sound barrier to spread fear.And, since October, Israel has been spreading something else in southern Lebanon - choking, searing clumps of white phosphorus, contained in munitions.', 'The chemical substance ignites immediately on contact with oxygen. It sticks to skin and clothing and can burn through bone, according to the World Health Organization.Moussa al-Moussa - a farmer stooped by his 77 years - knows only too well.He says Israel fired white phosphorous shells at his land in the village of al-Bustan every day for over a month, robbing him of breath, and his livelihood.“I had my scarf on, and I wrapped it around my mouth and nose until I was brought to the hospital,” he tells me, gesturing to the red and white keffiyeh – the traditional Arab scarf - on his head.“We didn’t have any masks.  I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t see a metre in front of me. And if you touch a fragment a week later it will ignite and burn again.”The international campaign group, Human Rights Watch, has verified the use of white phosphorus over several populated areas in southern Lebanon, including al-Bustan.It says Israel’s use of white phosphorus is “unlawfully indiscriminate in populated areas”.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) dispute this, saying the use of white phosphorus shells to create a smokescreen “is lawful under international law”.  It says these shells are not used in densely populated areas “with certain exceptions”.', 'Like many farmers along the border, Moussa fears Israel has poisoned his tobacco crop and his olive groves.“White phosphorous burns the ground, it burns people and the crops and buildings,” he says.Even if he can return home, he is afraid to bring in a harvest in case it harms his family or his buyers.He lives in limbo - in classroom 4B of a vocational school in Tyre. About 30 families who fled the border area are sheltering in the building. Washing is strung across the school yard. A lone little boy races up and down the empty corridors on a bicycle.When I ask Moussa how many wars he has seen, he begins to laugh.“We spent our lives in wars,” he says. “Only God knows if another one is coming.”', 'As one of Hezbollah’s most senior commanders, Mohammed Nimah Nasser, was a wanted man. He fought Israel in 2006, and before, and went on to fight in Syria and Iraq. In recent months he “planned, led and supervised many military operations against the Israeli enemy”, according to Hezbollah.Israel tracked him down in Tyre on 3 July. Death came from the sky in broad daylight, with an air strike which turned his car into a fireball.In the Hezbollah stronghold of south Beirut, he was given a hero’s funeral, or rather a “martyr’s” one.The event was carefully choreographed and strictly segregated - men in one area, women in another - including the press.His coffin, draped in the yellow flag of Hezbollah, was carried by pall bearers in camouflage uniforms and red berets. Many more fighters stood to attention, lines deep. There was a brass band in spotless white uniforms, if not in perfect harmony.It had the feel of a state funeral - in a country that lacks a functioning state.Lebanon has no president, a caretaker government and a shattered economy. It is carved up by sect, and hollowed out by corruption, its citizens left to fend for themselves. Many Lebanese are weary. The last thing they want is another war.But as the funeral prayers concluded, the talk among mourners was of “martyrdom” not death, and of readiness for war, if it comes.', 'Hassan Hamieh, a 35-year-old nurse, told us he would fight. “We are not afraid,” he said.“In fact, we are longing for an all-out war. Martyrdom is the shortest path to God. Young or old, we will all take part in this war, if it is forced upon us.”Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has stressed the armed group is ready, but not eager, for war. He says if there is a ceasefire agreed in Gaza, Hezbollah will cease fire too, immediately.Will that satisfy Israel? Maybe not.It sees Hezbollah as a permanent threat too close for comfort. At the very least, it wants its heavily armed enemy to pull back from the border.There have been plenty of bellicose threats. Israel’s Education Minister, Yoav Kish, said Lebanon would be “annihilated”. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant chimed in, saying the country would be returned “to the stone age”.As the attacks and counter attacks continue, families are destroyed. This month parents have been ripped from children, and children from parents.An Israeli couple were killed in their car by Hezbollah rockets as they headed for home in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria. They left behind three teenage children. And in southern Lebanon three children were killed in an Israeli strike earlier this week. They were aged between four and eight, and their parents were Syrian farm workers.The IDF approved “operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon” a month ago.For now, no tanks are rolling over the border. There has been no political decision to attack. Israel is still waging war in Gaza and fighting on two fronts could overstretch the military.But without a diplomatic solution between Israel and Hezbollah - two old enemies - all-out war may be coming, if not now, then later.Additional reporting by Goktay Koraltan and Ghassan Ibraheem']"

""People cut corners and when you try to raise alarm, some feel that you are trying to victimise or oppress them. They use their people in positions of authority to circumvent the rules.""', 'Following the building collapse at Saints Academy, the local governor has ordered a structural audit of all schools and public buildings in Plateau state, of which Jos is the capital. Officials in his government say it is not clear whether the school’s owner, who has since died, ever had a construction permit for the site.The BBC was unable to get comment from the school\'s management.Some also suspect that mining activity close by could have damaged the school building, so the governor has also ordered the arrest of any artisanal miners found digging in residential areas in the state.But officials suspect that the main problem was with how the school was built.""Even as a layman who is not a building professional, you can see that the materials used in the construction are not standard. But we will investigate the cause of the collapse and punish those found culpable,"" Musa Ashom, the state Commissioner for Information, tells the BBC.Similar promises came from Nigeria\'s Housing Minister, Ahmed Dangiwa, who spoke scathingly of ""unscrupulous"" individuals whose actions he said had resulted in the Jos school collapse and caused unquantifiable loss.But those words will come as little consolation to the many bereft families, like that of Chinecherem Joy Emeka.The 13-year-old was one of the best dancers at her school and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day, says her mother Blessing Nwabuchi.Chinecherem, or Chi Chi as loved ones called her, was sitting her end-of-year exams the day she died.Photos like this one, from her junior high graduation last year, are precious reminders of what she achieved - and everything she might have gone on to become.', ""Should I stay or should I go?

Kenya's ‘serial killer’ mystery - five key questions,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19k0zj1dw3o#3,"Still reeling from the discovery of bodies in a quarry, Kenyans are trying to find out more.","Tue, 16 Jul 2024 23:58:35 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.589695,"['The arrest of an alleged serial killer in Kenya has shocked the country - but many have serious questions about the circumstances of his arrest.Police say Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, confessed to killing 42 women - though his lawyer told a court on Tuesday he was tortured into a confession.It is the latest twist in a perplexing story that followed the recent discovery of the dismembered remains of nine bodies wrapped in plastic at a disused quarry, which is used as rubbish tip and is close to a police post in the capital, Nairobi.', ""Many people are finding it hard to understand that the police were unable to detect that bodies were being left around 100m (109 yards) from one of their offices in the informal settlement of Mukuru Kwa Njenga.Residents have criticised officers for their “laxity and unprofessionalism” in dealing with the crime.In response, acting police chief Douglas Kanja announced on Sunday that the officers from Kware police post near the scene had been transferred.It is not clear whether they have been questioned over how the deaths went unnoticed.But given the force's poor human rights record, the police watchdog said it was undertaking a preliminary investigation to establish whether there was any police connection."", 'What is even more baffling is how a member of the public came to discover them.The family of Josephine Owino, who had gone missing, says she came to one of them ""in a dream"" and helped point them in the right direction.Diana Keya, Ms Owino’s cousin, told Citizen TV that the family then paid some young men near the rubbish tip to comb through the debris.That was how nine severely mutilated bodies were found on Friday. They were wrapped in nylon bags, which were tied with rope.The first statement by police said the “alarm was raised” by the public.When questioned later the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations Mohamed Amin said: “We are not dreamers and we do not believe in dreams.”', ""Police said the bodies recovered were in different stages of decomposition, suggesting that the victims had been killed at different times.In the now-disputed confession, the police say Mr Khalusha allegedly admitted to murdering the women over a period of two years.What is not clear, though, is whether the remains had been dumped over that time or more recently.Hussein Khalid, the executive director of rights group Haki Africa, told the BBC that the police's version of events had “a lot of loopholes”."", 'After not apparently suspecting anything for two years the police then made an arrest in less than three days after the discovery of the bodies.On Monday, police said Mr Khalusha was detained at a bar in the small hours of that morning while watching the Euro final football match.They displayed to the media some of the items said to have been recovered from the suspect’s house - also close to where the bodies were found - including 10 phones, a laptop, identity cards and personal female clothing.The police said they had traced Mr Khalusha’s whereabouts after geo-locating the mobile phone of one of his alleged victims.Mr Khalusha’s lawyer has questioned the validity of the evidence.', 'Only one body has been identified so far - that of 24-year-old Roseline Ongogo.Her brother Emmanuel Ongogo told the BBC she went missing on 28 June after she left the house to look for casual work.He said the family went to the morgue when they heard bodies had been recovered from Mukuru.They identified her as she in the same clothes she had disappeared wearing and had the same hairstyle.', ""The police also allege that Mr Khalusha's wife was his first victim and say her identity card was found among the belongings of other alleged victims.The family of Ms Owino, who said they dreamt about her whereabouts, told the BBC they were still waiting for an identification."", ""The discovery has brought back memories of the brutal murder of 20-year-old Rita Waeni in January.Her dismembered body was found at a short-term rental apartment in Nairobi. The case is yet to be solved.The death triggered nationwide demonstrations against the rising cases of femicide and other violence against women.Amnesty International said more than 500 cases of femicide were recorded in Kenya between 2016 and 2023.All the bodies recovered from the rubbish tip are female. A handful of elected women leaders who converged at morgue asked the government to speed up the investigations and put an end to such violence.When asked what the police were doing to address cases of femicide and violence against women, spokesperson Resila Onyango said she could not address that issue specifically - but she told the BBC that the work of the police was “to protect life and property of everyone”.This scrutiny of the police comes as more Kenyan officers arrive in Haiti, where they are leading an international mission to tackle the country's powerful gangs. Lobby groups in Port-au-Prince have previously questioned the credibility of the officers over claims of brutality and extra-judicial killings, which Kenya's government has always denied."", 'Kenya protesters traumatised by abductions - lawyer‘We are the Church’: Kenyan tax protesters take on Christian leadersKenyan cult leader charged with 191 murders', 'Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica']"

New tech aims to keep polar bears and people apart,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cljy48yj99wo#3,Fears about the two species coming into contact are growing as Arctic sea ice melts.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 23:40:43 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.590318,"[""At the end of the Canadian Arctic summer, polar bears head inland to wait for the ice to form.   And while thousands of tourists  flock to catch a glimpse of these magnificent predators, researchers are developing novel ways to keep people and bears safely separated.  New tracking devices that stick in polar bears’ fur could be the key to protecting both people and bears - by closely monitoring the animals' locations.Polar bears now spend more of the year on land, as Arctic sea ice melts, so conservationists are increasingly concerned about bears and people coming into contact.The tracking tags, which have been tested on bears in Canadian Arctic, could help prevent those encounters, by “keeping a remote eye” on the bears."", 'Lead researcher Tyler Ross, a PhD candidate from York University in Toronto, said the fur tags were “particularly promising” for the prevention of these “human-bear interactions”.In communities in the southern Canadian Arctic, where the scientists tested these tags, polar bears that wander too close to a community are sometimes caught, transported and released in carefully selected sites away from towns and villages. “These tags could be fitted to those bears to monitor where they are after they\'ve been released,” explained Mr Ross.“If they\'re coming back towards the community, conservation staff would have a sense of where they are, and they could head them off. I think that\'s where they offer considerable promise.""The researcher, who studies polar bear ecology, also says the tags could fill important gaps in knowledge about the bears. And as the Arctic climate warms up rapidly, the need to monitor bears becomes increasingly urgent.', ""“There's a dearth of information about male polar bear movements, because they can't be equipped with conventional tracking collars,” said Mr Ross.The sea ice [that the polar bears use as a platform from which to hunt] is disappearing faster than it has in the past,” explained Mr Ross. “So the winter hunting season is getting shorter. We want to know where they're moving in response.”Polar bears are difficult to tag. Male bears’ heads are smaller than their necks, so tracking collars can just slip off.Another option is ear tags - attached by piercing the bear’s ear. They require an animal to be recaptured in order to remove the tag and, in rare cases, can injure the ear.The three new tags the researchers tested were designed by the company 3M in collaboration with the charity Polar Bears International. They all attach to the bears’ coarse fur.To fit the tags, scientists had to locate and sedate bears. They then assessed the quality of the data they received from each device and noted when the tags fell off."", 'The best performing device was called a SeaTrkr tag, which is “crimped” into the bears’ fur. It stayed attached for an average of 58 days and  - with an in-built GPS system - allowed the scientists to pinpoint the bears’ location to within just a few metres.“It’s ideal to have something that falls off naturally - that’s not permanently  attached to the bear,” explained Mr Ross. “But anything that lasts in the order of a few months would be great [for our research], because then you’re getting these important seasons that the bears are going through throughout the year.”Climate change is bringing bears and humans into closer proximity, making places where polar bears and people coexist, riskier for both.One  US Geological Survey study in 2022 that that used data from satellite tracking collars on more than 400 polar bears in Alaska, shows the time they spend onshore has grown significantly in recent decades.“Getting a better sense of polar bears’ movements is really crucial,” Mr Ross commented. “Particularly given the state of their environment at this point.”This study of the bear tags is published in the journal Animal Biotelemetry.

Votes for 16-year-olds fails to make King's Speech,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd09l31rrjo#0,Commons leader Lucy Powell says the measure remains a Labour commitment for the current parliament. ,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 13:38:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.882855,"['Labour\'s manifesto pledge to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 in UK general elections has not been included in the King\'s Speech. But Commons leader Lucy Powell told the BBC votes for 16 and 17-year-olds remained a commitment, and she hoped they would be able to vote in the next general election.Forcing members of the House of Lords to retire at the age of 80 was another pledge which did not make the cut when King Charles read out the new government\'s planned laws for the new parliamentary session. During the recent election campaign, the Conservatives accused Labour of trying to ""distort the political system"" to entrench itself in power.   ', 'Then-Home Secretary James Cleverly warned that measures like extending the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds were an attempt by Labour to ""lock in their power permanently, because they don\'t really feel confident they\'re going to be able to make a credible case to the British people at the next election"".Pressed on Radio 5 Live on why lowering the voting age had not featured in this  King\'s Speech, Ms Powell said there were ""plenty of big bills that didn’t make it into this"".  An elections bill would come later in the parliamentary cycle, she promised, adding:  ""It\'s absolutely a manifesto commitment."" Asked if 16 and 17-year-olds would be able to vote in the next general election, she said: ""I hope so. That\'s the intention.""

That was intended to be only a short-term compromise, but the arrangements have persisted for 25 years. The King indicated that further constitutional changes were likely later in the parliamentary cycle.The government would ""strengthen the integrity of elections and encourage wide participation in the democratic process"", he said.  Alex Norris, a minister in the housing, communities and local government department, posted on X: ""Too many people feel their voice is not being heard in our democracy, with millions of legitimate voters still not registered to vote.""This Government will restore faith in politics. From introducing votes at 16 to handing power back to communities with our English Devolution Bill, we will give those who contribute to our country a say in how it is governed."" The UK voting age was last lowered in 1969 - from 21 to 18 - by Harold Wilson\'s Labour government. The age was reduced to 16 for elections in Scotland - by the Scottish Parliament - in 2015.

Falling clothes prices help keep inflation rate steady,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck7gzllwlmlo#0,"The cost of living rose at 2% in the year to June, in line with the Bank of England's target.","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 08:57:09 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.883108,"['UK inflation held steady in June, remaining at the Bank of England\'s target rate of 2%, according to the latest official figures.Discounts on clothes in summer sales helped offset the soaring cost of hotel stays.Overall, inflation rose at 2% in the year to June, unchanged from May.It means that the cost of living is still rising but at a rate that the central bank is comfortable with, after nearly three years of above-target inflation which has squeezed household finances.The latest figures showed clothing and footwear costs fell last month, while food and drink inflation has dropped sharply from the highs of recent years.Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), told the BBC\'s Today programme that there was a ""higher level of discounting"".The figures also showed that second-hand car costs fell but by less than the same time last year.Prices in restaurants and hotels rose more than a year ago though, putting some upward pressure on the headline inflation rate. ', 'Hotel prices jumped by 8.8% compared with the previous month, the ONS said, whereas prices in restaurants and cafes went up by 0.3% on a monthly basis.The figures also showed the costs of package holidays, cinemas, theatres and concerts were rising.', 'However, in areas like services, which include everything from restaurants to hairdressers, price increases remain persistent.That could raise questions for Bank of England policymakers over when they should begin to cut interest rates.Darren Jones, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, said that families\' budgets across Britain were still being squeezed.""We face the legacy of 14 years of chaos and economic irresponsibility. That is why this government is taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off.""The Bank\'s base rate - which is used to help set mortgage rates and other borrowing costs - currently stands at a 16-year-high of 5.25% after it was increased in a bid to tackle soaring inflation.Its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which votes to set the rate, has held interest rates at this level for several months but some economists have predicted they will cut the rate at the next vote on 1 August.Leanne Morgan and her husband Gareth bought their house in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2016 when interest rates were much lower. Their five-year fixed mortgage deal came to an end this month and their new rate stands at just over 4% - pushing their mortgage payments up by £5,200 a year. ', 'Mrs Morgan said the higher mortgage payments had restricted the things they were able to do with their three older children.""We can\'t have family holidays, we\'ve not been able to do so much with the children... it affects where I shop for food, I’m always looking for discounts. We sit together, we look at what our costs are, where we can cut back and look at a budget.""She said she was optimistic, however, that the UK economy was over the worst and that better times were ahead.""I think sometimes the doom and gloom that we talk about can actually make us feel very negative,"" she said.""But if we have a good conversation about what is possible, and working with what we\'ve got, we can have a better conversation about it.""The overall inflation rate has fallen sharply since October 2022, when it peaked at 11.1%. But some of the underlying measures of inflation being watched closely by the Bank of England remain stubbornly high. Inflation in the services sector, for example, remained at 5.7% in June, while core inflation, which strips out the effects of more volatile items like energy prices, held at 3.5%. ', 'Alongside some other stronger figures for the economy in recent days, it may give some pause for thought for members of the Bank of England committee deciding interest rates next month. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund listed the UK among countries who might need to keep interest rates ""higher for even longer"" than originally anticipated to squeeze inflation out of the system.Markets have been anticipating that rate cuts will start on 1 August, helping fixed mortgage rates fall. The latest numbers suggest it will be a finely balanced decision.On Wednesday investors pared back bets on a rate cut taking place, saying there was about a 35% chance - down from just under 50% before the data was published.Separately, fresh official figures on the housing market helped give an insight into the costs facing both buyers and renters.They show the rate at which UK rents are rising is close to a record high, hitting 8.6% in the 12 months to June. The pace of the increase slowed very slightly on the previous month but remains well above the norm of the last 15 years or so.House prices also rose by 2.2% in the year to May, the ONS said, with the average price of a home in England now above £300,000.']"

Amazon workers narrowly reject union in historic vote,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vd72zrpr1o#1,If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. ,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:05:05 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.883800,"['The GMB has narrowly lost its historic bid for union recognition at the Amazon warehouse in Coventry. Some 49.5% of workers balloted voted in favour, while 50.5% voted against. The union needed a majority to vote in favour.If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. The online giant would have been forced to negotiate with workers on issues such as pay and conditions.In a statement, Amazon said it placed ""enormous value on engaging directly"" with staff.""We look forward to continuing on that path with our team in Coventry,"" it added.The GMB told the BBC it is considering trying again to get recognition at the Coventry site and that discussions are taking place about its strategy. The process would include persuading the Central Arbitration Committee, which is in charge of overseeing applications for recognition, that the pool of workers eligible to vote had changed.', 'The GMB, which lost by 28 votes, said its drive for recognition fell “agonisingly short” and accused Amazon of “union-busting”.It said there were “anti-union messages by company bosses, including multiple anti-union seminars” at the warehouse.It added that “the fire lit by workers in Coventry and across the UK is still burning”, and that the union would “carry on the fight”  for low paid workers.', ""The union's fight for recognition had been described as a David vs Goliath battle, with workers facing fierce resistance from the online giant.It began with a rag tag show of defiance in the summer of 2022, after Amazon offered workers a pay rise of between 35p and 50p an hour. Having toiled in warehouses during the Covid pandemic, workers said this felt like an insult, and in Coventry a small group of angry workers spontaneously walked out and protested outside the fulfilment centre. Then the GMB got involved and urged the workforce to unionise.In January 2023, with a GMB membership of just 50, Coventry workers held the first ever Amazon strike in the UK. "", 'It went on to organise a further 37 days of industrial action over the last year and by recruiting on the picket line, steadily built up its membership to more than 1,400 members out of the centre\'s estimated 3,000 plus workers.In April the union launched a legal challenge against Amazon, claiming it used underhand tactics to encourage members to cancel their union membership.On Wednesday it said that legal challenge would continue. As part of the challenge, the GMB says Amazon put up posters in fulfilment centres featuring QR codes that generated an email to the union’s membership department requesting that their membership be cancelled.Amazon responded saying that “employees were telling us they wanted to cancel their membership but could not find a way to do so, so we provided information to help. ""We have always been clear, that union membership is an employee’s personal choice.”', 'Amazon, which is one of the UK\'s largest private sector employers, with 75,000 workers, made it clear all along that it did not want to recognise a union and that it wanted to retain direct communication with its staff. After the vote on Wednesday, it further reiterated that “having daily conversations” with staff was “an essential part of our work culture”.“We value that direct relationship and so do our employees. This is why we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, act on their feedback, and invest heavily in great pay, benefits and skills development,"" the firm added.The GMB says it is surprised by what it sees as the fearlessness of an overwhelmingly immigrant workforce, many of whom arrived recently from South Asia. Union organisers estimate that as little as 5% of the Coventry employees are British born and its campaign leaflets were translated into 12 different languages. They say that in the beginning many were frightened to get involved but as the strikes wore on, and people saw that workers who’d joined picket lines weren’t facing disciplinary action, their confidence grew.The union is hopeful that the government will strengthen their power to organise. Labour has promised legislation in today\'s King\'s Speech to make it easier for unions to win recognition ballots by lowering the required threshold for victory and to make it easier for union officials to recruit in workplaces.', 'The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said that despite taking on one of the ""world\'s largest corporate giants"", the Coventry union members ""only narrowly missed out"" on securing recognition.""With Labour set to usher in a new era of stronger workers’ rights, companies like Amazon are on the wrong side of history,"" he added.But Gregor Gall, a professor of industrial relations at Glasgow university, questioned whether GMB had the resources to take the fight to other Amazon centres.""The cost of union organising is very high. The GMB had officers working full time on it. We won\'t necessarily see organising drives elsewhere,"" he said.Professor Gall\'s caution is understandable considering what has happened in the United States. In 2022 Amazon workers at its Staten Island warehouse in New York became the first in the US to win union recognition. Two years on, the company has still not sat down to negotiate with the union and continues to fight legal challenges to the vote.']"

The BBC understands he took his own life.A fatal accident inquiry - which is mandatory for any death in custody - will be held to examine the circumstances.A prison service spokesperson said: “Every death, whether in prison custody or in our communities, is a tragedy for all those who knew and supported the individual.“Following the death of someone in our care, Police Scotland are advised, and the matter reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Fatal accident inquiries are held in due course.”The 17-year-old was sent to Polmont after pleading guilty to a charge of acting in a disorderly manner and being in possession of weapons with intent to ""assault and murder"" a 16-year-old girl.He had put an airgun, shovel, wrench, duct tape and rope in the boot of a car as he went looking for the girl in Moray in March last year.While the case was ongoing, he stayed in a secure children’s unit before being moved to Polmont.Police Scotland said officers had been made aware of the death of a 17-year-old at Polmont and it was not thought to be suspicious.', 'The Scottish government said in March 2022 that 16 and 17-year-olds would no longer be placed in young offenders institutions.It said it wanted to end the placement of under-18s in custody ""without delay"", and pledged to fund ""care-based alternatives"" and shift the approach from ""one of punishment to one of love and support"".The announcement came after Scotland\'s chief inspector of prisons, Wendy Sinclair-Gieben, said sending 16 and 17-year-olds to Polmont - especially those who had not yet been convicted - was a breach of their human rights.The Children (Care and Justice) (Scotland) Bill - which sets out that children under the age of 18 will no longer be sent to prison - received Royal Assent last month and became an act of parliament.Separate legislation passed by Holyrood to incorporate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) came into force on Tuesday.As of 12 July, there were nine 16 to 17-year-olds held in custody at Polmont. Six were untried, two had been sentenced and one had been awaiting sentencing.', 'Wendy Sinclair-Gieben told BBC Scotland News, the “intent” to remove children from prisons in Scotland was there, but the speed at which it was being achieved was “not great”.She told BBC News: ""There should be no more children in prison. I don’t think Polmont is a good place for children.”Minister for Victims and Community Safety Siobhian Brown, said every death in custody was a tragedy and that the government was working to end the placement of under-18s in young offenders institutions.She said: ""We are working with the Scottish Prison Service and secure accommodation providers to commence these provisions shortly. The decision on whether to detain a child remains with the independent judiciary.”', ""A joint fatal accident inquiry (FAI) was held earlier this year into the deaths of Katie Allan, 21, and William Brown, 16, who both took their own lives at Polmont within months of each other in 2018. Katie, a geography student at Glasgow University, was jailed for16 months for drink-driving after hitting a 15-year-old boy, who was knocked unconscious.William, also known as William Lindsay, who had never been convicted of a crime, had only been sent to Polmont because a place could not be found for him in a secure children's unit.A separate FAI was also recently held into the death of Jack McKenzie, who took his own life at Polmont on 3 September 2021.He had been on remand at Polmont for rape and sexual assault charges - which he denied - since January of that year."", 'Katie Allan’s mother, Linda Allan told BBC Scotland she is “devastated” for Jonathan Beadle\'s family but she is not surprised to hear about the latest death in Polmont.""The only thing that surprises me is that not more young people are dying,"" she said.Ms Allan has previously criticised the ""inadequacies of the prison suicide strategy, which apparently ignores evidence"" and ""the flawed system of relying on prisoners self-reporting suicide ideation"".Sheriff Simon Collins, who heard both inquiries, is expected to make recommendations for change when he delivers his determination into the circumstances of all three deaths later in the year.The purpose of an FAI is to establish whether the deaths could have been prevented.It will also examine what precautions could be taken in future to try and stop young people from taking their own lives in prison.']"

Opposition parties have called for the first minister to fill the roles vacated.Meanwhile Wales\' previous first minister Mark Drakeford has said that Mr Gething was ""haunted"" by decisions he took which he has never been able to shake off.Mark Drakeford said the outgoing Welsh Labour leader was ""dogged"" by decisions taken over campaign donations and the sacking of a minister.Another former holder of Wales\' top job, Alun Michael, said Mr Gething had been ""forced out"".', 'Mr Miles came second in the leadership contest in March with 48.3% of the vote, versus Mr Gething\'s 51.7%.Since the result he moved from the job of education minister to economy secretary under the new first minister.He had declined to give a view on the £200,000 donation from a controversial waste company, whose owner had been previously convicted of environmental offences, during the campaign itself - but a month later said he would not have accepted the money.On Monday, a day before his resignation, he repeatedly failed to support Mr Gething in an interview.In his letter to the first minister outlining why he was quitting, Mr Miles said: ""The events of the last few months including you loss of the confidence vote in the Senedd have been incredibly painful.""This has become a distraction from the important work of the Welsh government and is damaging our party"".Dates for the contest are yet to be set, although Mr Gething has said his replacement would be installed by the autumn.', 'But two supporters of the first minister have told BBC Wales that Mr Miles\' involvement in forcing Mr Gething\'s exit makes him unsuitable to take over.One Gething supporter suggested they would rather ""die in a ditch"" than have Mr Miles as leader of the party.They said they would like to see Eluned Morgan run, saying she was a communicator who could connect the party with traditional backers of Labour.Another supporter said Mr Miles could not unite the party and there was ""a very strong feeling that the person who is associated with a bloodied knife cannot claim the crown"".They added: ""I\'m really worried about what this says to the world, to people in the United Kingdom and especially in Wales who are not white.""It looks like a bunch of people have drawn daggers and knifed Vaughan without giving him a chance. I do find that really difficult to deal with.""In a response, a backer of Mr Miles said: “The people who did their best to block Jeremy last time are up to their old tricks, it seems. Let the members decide.""Mr Miles had more nominations from Labour Senedd members than Mr Gething last year, with 16 versus Mr Gething\'s ten.', 'A separate Miles supporter said it was not ""credible"" for Mr Gething to carry on through the summer as he no longer had the support of ""the group, cabinet or Senedd"".

Faisal Islam: Labour's plans are not a quick fix for UK economy,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978n5ln7g3o#3,It will take well into next year before we see any impact on economic growth from these plans.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 14:06:53 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.887044,"['The King’s Speech seeks to fix some of the plumbing, wiring and foundations of the economy to “get Britain building”.It will take well into next year before we see any impact on economic growth from these plans.In fact, the primary piece of legislation announced by His Majesty is to promote “economic stability”. This is noteworthy. Stability is not something that normally needs legislating for, but something which would be taken for granted in the UK.The plans outlined include a lot of fiddly changes to how the government makes big decisions on planning, infrastructure, housing and transport. The bottom line is to give private investors more certainty about the economy and about policy.The “Budget Responsibility Bill”, for example, is an elaborate way of saying there will never be another disastrous Liz Truss mini-Budget moment. No future chancellor will be able to wave away the judgement of the government’s independent financial forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) as occurred in late 2022, when Truss announced £45bn in unfunded tax cuts.The hope is that this will be such a rock of credibility and stability that investment into the UK will boom, and borrowing rates for householders, businesses and the government itself will fall back and not go back up again. Internally they call this “fixing the foundations”.', ""Follow live updates on the King's SpeechKey points in King's Speech at a glanceWhat is the King's Speech and why is it important?Watch Labour's first King's Speech: What happened in 60 seconds"", ""The OBR’s role in judging the affordability of every single policy, elsewhere in the speech, is now hard-wired. It also has an immediate role in judging whether all the other policies announced actually promote growth. This is the most power the OBR has ever had and gives it huge influence over this government's policies.Is this transformative? The government argues that stability itself is almost revolutionary after several years of rolling chaos. But does the chancellor really need legislation to prevent her from doing a Liz Truss?The really big consequence of this approach is to point to a moment this summer when the OBR will decide whether all these reforms actually will boost growth.It has previously given credit to policies that it expects to boost the economy, for example factoring in former chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s childcare policy into its growth forecasts.If the OBR does this again for Labour’s planned draft laws then it will help “improve the so called trade-offs” and there will be less pressure to cut spending or raise taxes.If the OBR does not believe Labour’s plans will boost growth significantly then it’s difficult to see how it can avoid raising taxes or detailing spending cuts at the forthcoming Autumn Budget and Spending Review.The government is using its large landslide majority to push through some politically painful changes that should boost growth longer term.It will be a wait to see if it works, and it’s currently putting a lot of emphasis on measures which may take a long time to deliver.""]"

The streets with 56 burglaries and none solved,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gkrmdz94o#3,Figures suggest not one break-in on the residential street has ended up with someone punished.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 05:57:03 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.887409,"['Figures suggest 56 burglaries were recorded on streets in an area of Leeds - but police have failed to solve a single one. BBC News went to Rothwell to find out what residents think about the statistic.', 'An industrial estate at one end, and at the other, a quaint 19th Century Anglican church and pub. In the mile and a bit between these local landmarks are more than 300 homes.Wood Lane, in the south Leeds suburb of Rothwell, is like many other UK streets of its kind, with bus stops, a bakery, shops, a hairdresser and other day-to-day amenities. But burglaries on this street and the surrounding area have gone unsolved.', 'Research for Channel 4\'s Dispatches suggests that 56 break-ins had occurred in an area known as Rothwell Outer, none of which had resulted in a conviction.   West Yorkshire Police says its burglary detection rates are in-line with other parts of the country, but that some offences were unsolved because of a lack of evidence.It says the figures quoted in the programme were solely for 2021 and involved break-ins to some homes but were mostly non-dwelling burglaries from places such as sheds and garages.One victim of burglary is Amanda, who has lived around here for 15 years. Her home was raided last winter, with thieves stealing cash and jewellery. She says the police were ""great"" in their initial rapid response to the incident, though she has been left in the dark since. ""They did everything they could do in the first instance,"" Amanda explains. ""They came out straight away and you had investigators come out to assess the scene within a matter of hours. ""In terms of anything since, we just presume nothing has happened because we have not heard anything. ""Then again, I don\'t really know what to expect because this has never happened to us before.""You just have to trust the police are doing what they can, and if they find the evidence they can link it to someone.""', 'Amanda suggests the geography of Wood Lane and surrounding streets, which feature an array of snickets, alleyways and side roads, may make the area potentially more attractive to burglars needing a quick getaway. Amanda says the incident did initially make her feel ""less safe"" but that she and her family have done what they can to make their home as secure as possible. She also says a local PCSO has knocked on the door in the months since, which she finds reassuring. But others are less complimentary about the police presence around here, even though the office of Rothwell\'s neighbourhood policing team sits nearby', 'Steve Sutton, who has lived on Wood Lane for 18 years, has not been a victim of burglary, but knows residents who have. ""It doesn\'t surprise me they haven\'t been solved,"" he says. ""The police presence is zero. You see them driving up and down very occasionally.""Steve says the burglaries make you ""a bit more conscious"" about what is going on, especially as he says some of the thefts have taken place during the day.But, he adds: ""Generally, in terms of other crime it\'s a decent area, to be fair.""', 'Long-serving Liberal Democrat councillor for the area Stewart Golton says there is ""frustration"" in the community, ""because there aren\'t enough police to respond to the issues that we\'ve got"". ""Those statistics about burglaries are not a surprise, because we encourage people to report crime and then it feels like the crime you do report doesn\'t get responded to,"" Mr Golton says. ""We appreciate it is hard to catch criminals once they have committed the crime but it would be nice to know there is least an attempt at doing so, because otherwise what is the deterrent for future criminals to not do it?""On the high street in Rothwell, about five miles south east of Leeds city centre, shoppers echo concerns about a lack of visible police presence and about anti-social behaviour. Quad bikes, a particular bugbear for many communities across West Yorkshire in recent years, are raised frequently as an issue. ', 'John Graham, who was himself a victim of an unsolved burglary more than a decade ago, says: ""They are going round in gangs and a lot of them are wearing balaclavas and masks now.""I have lived around here for 40 years and it has changed a lot - for the worse.""', 'Daniel Newton, 34, lives just a stone\'s throw from Rothwell town centre and says some of the quad bike issues are caused by young people riding in from nearby Middleton.But, he suggests, there is a vicious circle of some young offenders committing anti-social behaviour because society ignores them. ""I have found if you try to connect and engage with them, they engage with you in a reasonable way,"" he says.""But they become rebellious because no-one is really engaging with them and they feel like outsiders. ""So it becomes reciprocal.""', 'Chatting outside Morrisons on the main street are friends Mary Kiernan and Pat Firth. Ms Firth lives in nearby Lofthouse, but comes into Rothwell to shop. ""I haven\'t lived in Rothwell for 18 years, but when we did there was always a PCSO walking down here,"" she recalls.""When we lived here it was a lot different to what it is now. ""I can understand why people get edgy when there\'s young groups going around on quad bikes.""', 'West Yorkshire Police says it recognises ""the huge impact"" burglaries have on victims and has made ""significant investments"" to reduce burglaries, which have declined since 2019 in West Yorkshire. It adds: ""We are also committed to attending all home burglaries in line with recently published national guidance.""Some burglaries are finalised as unsolved because of a lack of evidence or because a suspect cannot be identified.""Our detection rates are relatively in-line with other police forces in England and Wales, but we continually work to improve the quality of burglary investigations by listening to feedback from victims, looking at new and improved ways of working and training, and upskilling our officers and staff.""Addressing the wider issues around neighbourhood policing, the force says: ""While Rothwell has some officers who work specifically within its community to provide a familiar presence for people, it does not have a set number of allocated officers and is part of a larger Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT), which covers the Leeds South area.""Police officers and staff who work within NPTs are deployed to the areas where they are needed the most, so communities can be provided with reassurance when they need it.""Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

Spiking is when someone puts alcohol or drugs into another person’s drink or body without their knowledge or consent.According to police, the majority of cases happen in public places such as bars and nightclubs.Although spiking is already illegal, its due to become a specific criminal offence under changes announced in the King\'s Speech, where the government announces its plans for the year ahead.MPs believe this will make it easier for police to respond to reports.', 'Symptoms of spiking can include memory loss, hallucinations and disorientation.EastEnders hopes to show viewers of the miniseries the symptoms through Anna\'s eyes as her night takes a turn for the worse.""I think it\'s so important that we show those signs,"" says Molly.The actress tells BBC Newsbeat it was ""really important"" for her to do her research to portray the experience accurately and highlight the symptoms.Molly also urges people to look out for their friends on nights out.""Are they acting differently? Is something not quite right?"" she says.', 'Molly hopes the series will create more awareness around spiking, and reach younger audiences online.""What better platform than social media to reach the people that it\'s directly affecting?"" Molly says.She adds she is constantly thinking about her safety on nights out. ""You have to kind of live in that bit of fear that it could happen and it\'s a real shame.""I’m lucky enough that I haven’t been spiked, but it shouldn’t be luck, it should be standard.""The effects of spiking are something Abbi Taylor, from Manchester, knows about all too well.""It was just the worst thing I\'ve experienced,"" she says.', 'Abbi, who\'s originally from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, says she realised she\'d been spiked as she got home from a day event two months ago.She describes the feeling as ""sheer panic"".""I started to notice my vision going blurry,"" she says. ""I started shaking, I was sweating."" As the effects grew stronger, Abbi says, she started to lose the ability to move her body.""I couldn\'t talk. If I tried to stand up - I\'d just collapse,"" she says.""It almost felt like I was trapped in this body that didn\'t feel like it was mine.""After having her drink spiked, Abbi says she no longer wants to go on nights out.Like Molly, she urges others to be alert to the signs.""If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone,"" she says.Dawn Dines, CEO of charity Stamp Out Spiking, which consulted on the EastEnders mini series, says ""education is key to preventing these incidents"".She hopes featuring the issue on EastEnders will ""inspire conversations"" that help to protect people.', 'The Metropolitan Police, which covers London, says 1,383 allegations of spiking were submitted in 2023 – an average of 26 allegations per week. It says reports increased by 13% in the last six months of 2023 compared with the same period the previous year.In 2023, the force made 70 arrests for spiking offences.Met Police Det Ch Supt Angela Craggs urged those who suspect they\'ve been spiked to come forward.Around the country, Samantha Millar, of the National Police Chiefs’ Council says, police forces have been ""working proactively"" to improve feelings of safety on nights out.""This includes regular, targeted patrols of busy town centres,"" Samantha says, adding that police also visit universities to raise awareness of spiking symptoms.The Home Office has said the law is part of the new Labour government\'s ""mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade"".The spiking law will apply in England and Wales.
