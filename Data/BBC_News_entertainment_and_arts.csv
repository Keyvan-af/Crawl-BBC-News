Biden calls for ban on gun used to shoot Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1x4xjvrgdo#0,"The US president resumes his campaign with criticism of Donald Trump and says the weapon used against him should be ""outlawed"".","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 13:46:13 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.585165,"[""Joe Biden has renewed a call for Congress to ban assault rifles, including the model that was used in the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Trump's ear was grazed by a bullet after a gunman shot at him from a nearby rooftop during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.“An AR-15 was used in the shooting of Donald Trump. This was the assault weapon that killed so many others, including children. It’s time to outlaw them,” Mr Biden told the audience at a convention in Las Vegas.His demand came as he returned to the campaign trail for the first time since the attack. "", ""Biden urges America to 'lower temperature' after Trump shootingIn maps: Donald Trump assassination attempt"", 'For several days following the shooting, the Biden campaign had been on pause. Verbal attacks had been halted, television ads pulled and a message of unity was pushed by many prominent Democrats.Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Biden continued in that vein, lamenting how “heated” politics has become. But later in his speech - an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP), a prominent civil rights group - he went on to roundly criticise Trump.“Just because our politics are very divided doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth. Who you are, what you’ve done, what you will do - that’s fair game,” he said.""Let me say it again because Trump is lying like hell about it,” he told the conference hall of primarily black voters. “Black unemployment hit a record low under the Biden-Harris administration,"" the president added. Statistics show that his government reached the record low unemployment rate for Black or African Americans in 2023, at 4.8%.Gun rights are an issue Mr Biden has frequently campaigned on.In 1994, he was instrumental in passing an assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004. He referenced that legislation during his speech, saying ""I\'ve done it before, I\'ll do it again"". In 2022, during his first term as president, Mr Biden signed into law the most significant gun safety legislation in more than two decades, which included enhanced background checks for gun buyers and other protections.But he has repeatedly come up against strong opposition from Republicans to an assault weapons ban.The president\'s return to the campaign trail came as the Republican National Convention (RNC) closed out its second day on Tuesday, with a line-up of speakers - including former presidential nominee rivals Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis - roundly uniting behind Trump.At a side event hosted by the gun rights group, US Concealed Carry Association, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign said Donald Trump would safeguard gun rights by appointing pro-gun judges if he is elected in November.""We\'ll see a continuation of supporting and defending the Second Amendment, and really where that comes into play is the judiciary,"" Chris LaCivita told attendees, according to Reuters news agency.Donald Trump has already said that he would unravel all of Mr Biden’s new gun rules if elected in November, a stance that shows no sign of changing even following Saturday’s attempt on his life.Authorities are yet to land on the motive of gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was able to shoot at Trump after climbing onto the roof of a building 130m (426ft) from where he was speaking.An independent review of the Secret Service’s handling of the shooting is underway and Republican leaders in Congress have also announced an investigation.']"
Cyanide found in blood of Bangkok hotel victims,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g64ljwp2go#0,Police suspect that one of the dead was behind the poisoning and was driven by crushing debt.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 14:21:38 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.585437,"['Cyanide has been found in the blood of all six people who died in a luxury hotel suite in Bangkok, say doctors after examining their bodies.Based on the initial post-mortem examination, they say there is ""no other cause"" that would explain their deaths ""except for cyanide"". But further tests are being carried out to determine the ""intensity"" of the deadly chemical and to rule out any other toxins.Forensic investigators had earlier found traces of cyanide on the teacups used by the victims, all of whom are of Vietnamese origin including two with dual US citizenship. Police suspect that one of the dead was behind the poisoning and was driven by crushing debt - but have not said who.The victims\' lips and nails had turned dark purple indicating a lack of oxygen, while their internal organs turned ""blood red"", which is another sign of cyanide poisoning, said Professor Kornkiat Vongpaisarnsin of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Chulalongkorn University.Doctor Chanchai Sittipunt, the dean of the Faculty of Medicine, said they still needed to find out how much cyanide was in the blood of the deceased.""But from what we have detected - from observation, from internal organ check, from finding cyanide in the blood during the screening test - there is no other cause that would be the factor that would cause their deaths, except for cyanide,” he told reporters.The deceased were found by housekeepers at the Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel in the Thai capital late on Tuesday.Investigators believe they had been dead for between 12 and 24 hours by then. The mystery around the shocking discovery made international headlines. Thailand\'s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin ordered an urgent investigation into the case, stressing that the deaths were the result of a ""private matter"", and there was no suggestion of public danger. Police have since begun to piece together what might have happened. Two of the six victims had loaned ""tens of millions of Thai baht"" to another of the deceased for investment purposes, authorities said. Ten million baht is worth nearly $280,000 (£215,000).', 'Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Bangkok police chief Gen Noppassin Poonsawat told a press conference the group checked into the hotel separately over the weekend and were assigned five rooms - four on the seventh floor, and one on the fifth. They had been scheduled to check out on Monday but failed to do so.Four of the victims are Vietnamese nationals Thi Nguyen Phuong, 46, her husband Hong Pham Thanh, 49, Thi Nguyen Phuong Lan, 47,  and Dinh Tran Phu, 37.The other two are American citizens Sherine Chong, 56, and Dang Hung Van, 55.The US state department has offered its condolences and said it is ""closely monitoring"" the situation. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting Thai authorities in the investigation, Mr Srettha said.', 'The motive is not clear, but police said two of the six had loaned a substantial amount of money to another person in the group, who had not been paid back.Police say on Monday afternoon all six victims gathered in the room on the fifth floor. The group ordered food and tea, which was delivered to the room around 14:00 local time (08:00 BST) and received by Ms Chong - who was the only person in the room at the time. According to the deputy police chief, a waiter offered to make tea for the guests but Ms Chong refused this. The waiter recalled that she “spoke very little and was visibly under stress”, authorities said.The waiter later left the room. The rest of the group then began streaming into the room at various points, between 14:03 and 14:17. No one else is believed to have entered the room apart from the six inside and police have said the door to the room was locked from within. ', 'Police say there were no signs of a struggle, robbery or forced entry. They later found traces of cyanide in all six tea cups.Pictures released by the police show plates of untouched food left on a table in the room, some of them still covered in cling wrap. There was a seventh name on the group\'s hotel booking, whom police identified as the younger sister of one of the victims. She had left Thailand last week for the Vietnamese coastal city of Da Nang and is not involved in the incident, police said. Relatives interviewed by the police said Thi Nguyen Phuong and Hong Pham Thanh, a couple, owned a road construction business and had given money to Ms Chong to invest in a hospital building project in Japan.Police suspect that Mr Tran, a make-up artist based in Da Nang, had also been “duped"" into making an investment. Mr Tran\'s mother Tuý told BBC Vietnamese that he had travelled to Thailand on Friday and had called home on Sunday to say he had to extend his stay until Monday. That was the last his family had heard from him. She rang him again on Monday but he did not answer the call. Ms Chong had hired Mr Tran as her personal make-up artist for the trip, one of his students told BBC Vietnamese. Mr Tran\'s father, Phu, told Vietnamese media that his son was hired last week by a Vietnamese woman to travel to Thailand.  The six bodies were discovered one day after Thailand expanded its visa-free entry scheme to travellers from 93 countries and territories to revitalise its tourism industry. ', ""Cyanide is a rapidly-acting, highly toxic chemical that is potentially deadly. Low levels of cyanide occur in nature and in products we eat and use. But in larger doses it is a notorious poison, and has been used as a chemical warfare agent because of its fast-acting and highly lethal properties.It can occur as a colourless gas or liquid or in crystal form. People can be exposed to cyanide by breathing it in, absorbing it through the skin, or eating food or liquids that contain it.When consumed in large amounts, cyanide can lead to lung injury, coma and death within seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Even in smaller doses, cyanide is still very harmful, causing chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath and vomiting.Cyanide can produce a “bitter almond” smell but not everyone can detect this and it doesn’t always give off an odour.Additional reporting by BBC Thai and BBC Vietnamese's Thuong Le""]"
"Hamas committed war crimes on 7 October, says Human Rights Watch",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vdz75g6dvo#0,"Hamas rejects what it calls the ""lies"" in HRW's report about the deadly attack on Israel that it led.","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:44:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.585644,"[""Hamas and at least four other Palestinian armed groups committed numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity against civilians during the 7 October attack on southern Israel, the campaign group Human Rights Watch says.A new report accuses the hundreds of gunmen who breached the Gaza border fence of violations including deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, wilful killing of persons in custody, sexual and gender-based violence, hostage-taking, mutilation of bodies and looting.It also found the killing of civilians and hostage-taking were “central aims of the planned attack” and not an “afterthought”.Hamas angrily rejected what it called HRW’s “lies” and demanded an apology.About 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others were taken as hostages when 26 Israeli communities and towns, as well as number of military bases, two music festivals and a beach party were attacked nine months ago.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza with the aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages.More than 38,790 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.HRW's report does not cover alleged violations of the laws of war by Israeli forces and Palestinian groups in the conflict that was triggered by the 7 October attack."", 'The report released by HRW on Wednesday is based on interviews with 144 people, including witnesses to the 7 October attack, as well as analysis of more than 280 photographs and videos posted on social media or shared with the group’s researchers.“Across many attack sites, [Palestinian] fighters fired directly at civilians, often at close range, as they tried to flee, and at people who happened to be driving vehicles in the area,” it says.“They hurled grenades and shot into safe rooms and other shelters and fired rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) at homes. They set some houses on fire, burning and suffocating people to death, and forcing out others who they then captured or killed,” it adds.“They took hundreds hostage for transfer to Gaza or summarily killed them.”Hamas’s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, led the assault, but HRW says it has strong evidence of the participation of at least four other Palestinian armed groups, based on headbands the gunmen wore and their claims posted on social media:al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)Omar al-Qasim Forces, the armed wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, the armed wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, which is linked to the Fatah movementThe BBC has previously reported that they took part in military-style exercises with Hamas from 2020 onwards which closely resembled the tactics used on 7 October. ', 'HRW’s report concludes that the Palestinian groups committed a widespread and systematic attack directed against a civilian population, which amounts to a crime against humanity, based on the numerous civilian sites that were targeted and “the planning that went into the crimes”.It also found that the killing of civilians and the taking of hostages were “all central aims of the planned attack, and not actions that occurred as an afterthought, or as a plan gone awry, or as isolated acts, for example solely by the actions of unaffiliated Palestinians from Gaza, and as such, there is strong evidence of an organisational policy to commit multiple acts of crimes against humanity”.The report says further investigation is needed into other potential crimes against humanity, including persecution against any identifiable group on racial, national, ethnic or religious grounds; rape or sexual violence of comparable gravity; and extermination, if there was a mass killing calculated to bring about the “destruction” of part of a population.The report includes a letter from Hamas responding to the allegations, in which the group said it was “committed to respecting international law” and that the al-Qassam Brigades “was clear in directing its members and fighters not to target civilians”.Hamas also said the participation of unaffiliated Palestinians from Gaza and other armed groups not involved in the initial, planned assault led to “chaos in the field”, a change in “the plan to conduct an operation against military targets” and “the occurrence of many mistakes”.The report says HRW found Hamas’s claim that its forces did not seek to harm Israeli civilians was “false”, noting that photos and videos showed gunmen seeking out civilians and killing them at various sites from the first moments of the attack.In a statement issued following the report’s publication, Hamas said: “We reject the lies and blatant bias towards the occupation [Israel] and the lack of professionalism and credibility in the Human Rights Watch report. We demand its withdrawal and an apology.”In a separate report in April, HRW said an Israeli air strike on a residential building in central Gaza on 31 October that killed 106 people constituted a war crime. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and accuses Hamas of operating in civilian structures.The group has also accused the Israeli government of using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, which is a war crime. Israel says it facilitates deliveries of humanitarian aid and is not to blame for Gaza’s food shortages.In May, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) applied for arrest warrants for Hamas’s Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, military chief Mohammed Deif and political leader Ismail Haniyeh for crimes against humanity and war crimes from 7 October onwards. He also sought warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Both Hamas and Israel reacted with outrage to the announcement.']"

The original is kept in the nearby Bargello museum.The photos sparked angry reactions from social media users, some of whom called for the woman\'s arrest.""This is the result of years of attempts at turning Florence into Disneyland,"" said another.Patrizia Asproni, the president of Confcultura, an association that promotes Italy\'s cultural heritage, told Italian media that these ""repeated shows of rudeness and barbarity"" take place ""because everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want with impunity"".Ms Asproni called for the application of the ""Singapore model"" with ""tight checks, sky-high fines and zero tolerance"" for bad behaviour.Antonella Rinaldi, Florence\'s archaeology and fine arts superintendent, said: ""Tourists are welcome here but they need to respect our artworks, be they originals or replicas.""""Although I doubt this lady - whom I condemn - even knows the difference,"" she added.Florence is one of the world\'s foremost tourist destinations. In 2023, around 1.5 million people visited the city - which has a population of just 382,000 - between June and September.Local residents have long struggled with the huge influx of tourists, which in the summer months turns Florence\'s narrow streets into steady streams of people. The so-called ""overtourism"" phenomenon has prompted several cities around the world to make changes to the way they welcome tourists. Last month, the mayor of Barcelona pledged to eliminate short-term tourist lets in the city within five years, while several hotspots - like Venice or Japan\'s Mount Fuji - have started to introduce daily charges to try to limit numbers.']"
Trump's defeated Republican rivals show united front at convention,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd0gn6nel6o#0,"Several of the former president's past challengers, including Nikki Haley, voiced full support for his candidacy.","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 03:56:22 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.586038,"['One by one, Donald Trump’s defeated rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination took the stage to sing his praises at the party\'s convention on Tuesday night.From his box just above the convention floor, Trump smiled at times as he watched his former opponents Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy voice their full support for his candidacy.If there were any doubts that this was Trump’s party, Tuesday’s programming put them to rest.“I’ll start by making one thing perfectly clear: Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,” said Ms Haley, the former UN Ambassador who posed the strongest challenge to Trump earlier this year.She said Trump had asked her to speak at the event in Milwaukee in the name of “unity"".“For the sake of our nation we have to go with Donald Trump,” she told the crowd.Ms Haley said in May that she would vote for the former president, but her headline speech on Tuesday was her most direct endorsement of the Republican nominee yet.And when she declared her endorsement, Trump stood and clapped.Ms Haley’s arrival, however, was not universally welcomed in the arena. There was a noticeable intake of breath as she acknowledged that she and Trump had their differences.Some Republicans have struggled to forgive her for launching an aggressive campaign against their favoured candidate. Late in the race, she questioned whether Trump had the mental stamina to serve as president.A smattering of boos greeted her as she took the podium, though they were soon drowned out by cheers and chants.She deserves the booing, said Gregory Switzer, a conservative activist from Texas.“She stayed in that race a lot longer than she needed to and dragged out the inevitable,"" said Matt Bumela, a delegate from Washington state who had predicted the booing. “And said things about Trump that were negative all the way up to the end.”', 'Ms Haley notably broke from Trump when she called for the US to continue to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.When she later said she would vote for him in November, she said the former president would be “smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me"".On Tuesday night, she told supporters of hers who might be on the fence: “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him – take it from me.”“Tonight is our unity night,” said New Hampshire state Senator William Gannon, who had served as a delegate for Ms Haley. He believed Trump made the right choice to invite her to speak.“I wanna win the national election,” he said. “It was a wise move to bring her in.”The third-place finisher in the primary, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, received a far more enthusiastic welcome from the crowd.He touched on several conservative social issues, including diversity initiatives, which he said were “indoctrination”.He urged the crowd to rally behind Trump – though they were already solidly behind their current nominee. “We cannot let him down, and we cannot let America down,” Mr DeSantis said.He also took a swipe at Mr Biden’s age, an issue that is currently roiling the Democratic Party. “We need a commander-in-chief who can lead 24 hours a day and seven days a week,” he said.Daniel Willis, the 25-year-old chair of the Delaware Young Republicans, said Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley did more than enough “to bridge the gap” with Trump supporters.LISTEN: Americast discusses the Republican rivals reunitedLara Trump, Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, hit a conciliatory tone, telling the crowd: “You don’t have to admit that you like everything that he tweets, but Americans were better off when he was in office.”She added: “Last Saturday reminded us that we Americans must remember that there is more that unites us than divides us.""The rest of the night was devoted to the more common Republican campaign points, such as migrant crossings at the border, crime and an overarching commitment to defeating Mr Biden.Ted Cruz, the US senator from Texas, said there was a “literal invasion” of the United States. Dr Ben Carson, who served in Trump\'s cabinet, accused Democrats of “shredding the Constitution"".Trump himself led a huge standing ovation for Madeline Brame, a woman whose son was killed in New York in 2018 and has since called for tough-on-crime policies.Down on the floor, delegates said they were ready to move beyond the intra-party divisions of the primary and instead focus the party’s energy on President Biden.“At the end of the day,” said Georgia delegate Pam Lightsey, “We’re all Republicans.”']"
Ex-CIA analyst charged with spying for South Korea,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5qd82pjlo#0,"Sue Mi Terry is accused of helping South Korea in exchange for cash, luxury bags, fancy meals and expensive clothes.

Sue Mi Terry, who previously worked as a senior official for the White House National Security Council, faces two counts of failing to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Federal officials say Ms Terry - a prominent US expert on North Korea - acted as an agent for the South Korean government for over a decade, but she did not register as a foreign agent with American officials, according to court documents made public on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York.The Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank where Ms Terry works as a senior fellow on Asia, has placed her on unpaid leave, a spokesperson told US outlets. The organisation has also removed her biography from its website. Ms Terry, 54, denies the charges and her attorney, Lee Wolosky, told the BBC the allegations against her were ""unfounded"".The charges ""distort the work of a scholar and news analyst known for her independence and years of service to the United States"", Mr Wolosky said. ""In fact, she was a harsh critic of the South Korean government during times this indictment alleges that she was acting on its behalf.""Born in South Korea, Ms Terry moved to the US at age 12, according to her previous employer at Columbia University. In 2001, she earned her doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, a prominent international relations school in Massachusetts. She is known to lecture in English and Korean.Ms Terry, 54, then went on to work as a senior analyst for the CIA from 2001 to 2008, before holding a variety of posts in the federal government, including as Director for Korea, Japan, and Oceanic Affairs at the National Security Council during the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Prosecutors say Ms Terry\'s work as an agent for the South Korean government began in 2013, about five years, after she stopped working for the CIA and the National Security Council. In the 31-page indictment, officials say Ms Terry admitted to FBI agents in a voluntary interview in 2023 that she was a “source” for South Korea’s National Intelligence Service. The indictment alleges that the South Korean government gifted Ms Terry a $2,845 (£2,100) Dolce & Gabbana coat, a $3,450 Louis Vuitton handbag and meals at upscale restaurants.Officials say the government also gave her $37,000 and came up with a plan to hide the source of the funds, ultimately placing them in a gift fund at the think tank where she worked. Ms Terry\'s indictment comes just a day after Democratic Senator Robert Menendez was convicted of helping foreign governments in exchange for luxury items including gold bars and a Mercedes car. ']"

Since losing her appeal against the ban, she has thrown her weight behind Edmundo González and campaigned on his behalf, criss-crossing the country and encouraging voters to unite behind him in order to defeat Mr Maduro at the polls. Dozens of members of her campaign team have been arrested, with some accused of involvement in anti-government conspiracies. ', 'Restaurant and food stall owners have also complained about their businesses being closed down by officials after they served the opposition leaders.The government alleges that the businesses were shuttered because their paperwork was not in order.The non-governmental organisation Foro Penal, which keeps a tally of what it says are political prisoners, said more than 100 people linked to the opposition had been detained in the run-up to the presidential election.Foro Penal said that the high number of arrests was a clear indication of  ""a systematic scheme"" to restrict the rights of Venezuelan citizens.Opinion polls give Edmundo González a huge lead over President Maduro, but many in the opposition fear the election result may be tampered with.The 2018 election in which Mr Maduro was re-elected to a second term was widely dismissed as being neither free nor fair. The opposition coalition led by Ms Machado is urging its supporters to turn out to vote despite these concerns, arguing that overwhelming support for their unity candidate will make it harder for any fraud to take place.']"
Trump's choice of running mate raises fears in Ukraine and EU,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727zvgvv8ko#1,Diplomats and politicians voice concern over JD Vance's repeated criticism of US aid to Ukraine.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 19:44:20 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.586730,"['European politicians and diplomats had already prepared for changes to their relationship with the US in the event of a second Donald Trump presidency.Now that the Republican candidate has chosen Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, those differences appear even more stark on prospects for the war in Ukraine, security and trade.A vocal critic of US aid to Ukraine, Mr Vance told this year’s Munich Security Conference that Europe should wake up to the US having to “pivot” its focus to East Asia. ""The American security blanket has allowed European security to atrophy,"" he said.Nils Schmid, a senior MP in German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s party, told the BBC that he was confident a Republican presidency would continue to stay within Nato, even if JD Vance came across as ""more isolationist"" and Donald Trump remained ""unpredictable"".However, he warned of a new round of ""trade wars"" with the US under a second Trump presidency.An EU diplomat said that after four years of Donald Trump no-one was naïve: ""We understand what it means if Trump comes back as a second-term president, regardless of his running mate.""Portraying the EU as a sailing boat preparing for a storm the diplomat, who preferred not to be named, added that whatever they might be able to tie down, it was always going to be rough.The US is Ukraine\'s biggest ally, and President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week: ""I\'m not afraid about him becoming president, we will work together.""', 'He also said that he believed most of the Republican party supported Ukraine and its people.Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump also have a common friend in Boris Johnson, the former UK prime minister, who has consistently championed continued aid for Ukraine and recently met the former president at the Republican National Convention.Following the meeting, Mr Johnson posted on X that he had “no doubt that [Mr Trump] will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy”.But even if that sentiment is true, it might not apply to Mr Vance, who, days before the full-scale invasion, told a podcast he “doesn’t really care what happens in Ukraine, one way or the other”. He also played a key role in delaying a $60bn military aid package from Washington.""We need to try and convince him otherwise,"" says Yevhen Mahda, the Executive Director of the Institute of World Policy think tank in Kyiv.""A fact we can use is that he fought in Iraq, therefore he should be invited to Ukraine so he can see with his own eyes what is happening and how American money is spent.""The question for Kyiv will be to what extent he can influence the decisions of his new boss.Yevhen Mahda agrees that Trump’s unpredictability could be a problem for Kyiv in the run-up to the US presidential election.The biggest supporter of the Trump-Vance ticket in the European Union is Hungary’s Viktor Orban who returned recently from a visit to see the Republican candidate, after visiting Mr Zelensky and President Putin, with whom he maintains close ties.In a letter to EU leaders, Mr Orban said a victorious Donald Trump would not even wait to be inaugurated as president before quickly demanding peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.', '""He has detailed and well-founded plans for this,"" the letter states.Mr Zelensky has himself said this week that Russia should attend a peace summit possibly next November, and he has promised a “fully ready plan”. But he made clear he had not come under Western pressure to do so.Viktor Orban\'s recent ""peace missions"" to Moscow and Beijing have sparked accusations that he’s abusing his country’s six-month rotating presidency of the European Council. European Commission officials have been told not to attend meetings in Hungary because of Mr Orban’s actions.During the Trump presidency, the US imposed tariffs on EU-produced steel and aluminium. Although they were paused under Joe Biden’s administration, Trump has since floated a 10% tariff on all overseas imports should he get back into the White House.The prospect of renewed economic confrontation with the US will be seen as a bad, even a disastrous, outcome in most European capitals.""The only thing we know for sure is there will be punitive tariffs levelled on the European Union so we have to prepare for another round of trade wars,"" said Nils Schmid, the Social Democrats’ foreign policy lead in the Bundestag.JD Vance singled out Berlin for criticism of its military preparedness earlier this year.While he didn’t mean to ""beat up"" on Germany, he said the industrial base underpinning its arms production was  insufficient.', 'This will all pile further pressure on Germany, Europe’s largest economy, to ""step up"" as a principal player in underwriting European security.After his much-lauded ""zeitenwende"" (turning point) speech in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Olaf Scholz was often accused of hesitancy on supplying weapons to Kyiv.But his allies are always keen to point out that Germany is second only to the US in terms of military aid to Kyiv while it has – for the first time since the end of the Cold War – met the 2% GDP defence spending target, albeit via short-term budgeting.""I think we are on the right track,"" said Mr Schmid. ""We have to build back an army that was neglected for 15 to 20 years.""But observers are far from convinced that behind-the-scenes European preparations are either serious or sufficient.There are few leaders with the political clout or inclination to champion the future security architecture of an unwieldy European continent.Chancellor Scholz has an understated style and clear resistance to taking a lead on bolder foreign policy positions – and faces a very real prospect of being voted out of office next year.French President Emmanuel Macron has been left a severely weakened figure after calling parliamentary elections that have left his country in a state of political paralysis.Polish President Andrzej Duda warned on Tuesday that if Ukraine loses its struggle against Russia “then Russia’s potential war with the West will be extremely imminent”.""This voracious Russian monster will want to attack on and on.""']"

Around 30 students ate the fiery snacks after one of them brought them to school on Tuesday, Japanese local media reported. Soon, some of them started complaining of nausea and acute pain around their mouth, prompting emergency calls to the fire department and police.The 13 girls and one boy who were taken to hospital were conscious and reportedly  had minor symptoms.The company that makes the snack, Isoyama Corp, put out a statement, apologising for ""any inconvenience"" to customers, and wished the students a swift recovery. The school and the company have not responded to the BBC\'s questions so far. The company website is full of warnings for those who may wish to try the crisps. It ""forbids"" those under 18 from consuming the crisps which are called  ""R 18+ curry chips"", because of how spicy they are - and it warns even those who love hot food to ""eat with caution"". The crisps are ""so spicy that they may cause you pain"", it says. The spiciness comes from the potent “ghost pepper”, cultivated in northeastern India, where it\'s known as bhut jolokia. Although it is used in recipes in India and elsewhere, it\'s known to be among the world\'s hottest chillis. The kick from your chilli can have side effectsThe Japanese firm, in fact, advises people not to ""eat the chips when they are alone” and says they could cause diarrhoea if eaten ""excessively"". Those with high blood pressure and weak stomachs ""are absolutely prohibited"" from eating the crisps, according to the company\'s website. It warns people who have cuts on their fingers to be careful while opening the packets. Those who are ""timid or too scared"" are also discouraged from trying the snack.One media report said one of the students, a boy, brought the crisps to school ""just for fun"".Responding to news about the hospitalisations, some X users posted a ""spicy meter"" to demonstrate how hot the crisps were, while others shared videos of their agonising experience of eating them. In one video, a user who appears to be wincing, described it as ""painful"" and said it reminded him of the time he had urinary stones.X owner Elon Musk also weighed in, saying ""they must be next-level spicy!""']"

And we’re going to win.”Mr Kennedy then says: “Yeah.”Trump and Mr Kennedy, a longshot third-party candidate, are political rivals who have occasionally criticised each other during the campaign.The footage is said to have been recorded on Sunday, a day before the pair met in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Republican convention is taking place, stoking speculation that Mr Kennedy might be about to exit the race and endorse Trump.But Kennedy spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said on Monday that he was not dropping out.Robert F Kennedy Jr posted on X on Tuesday: “When President Trump called me I was taping with an in-house videographer.“I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately.

Indian man stuck in lift for 42 hours thought he would die,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngwv59wq4o#1,Ravindran Nair entered a hospital lift on Saturday afternoon. He was rescued on Monday morning.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:36:15 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.588014,"['A man from the southern Indian state of Kerala, who got trapped in a hospital lift for 42 hours without any food or water, has told the BBC he feared he would die there.Ravindran Nair, 59, entered the lift to meet a doctor on Saturday afternoon - he then remained stuck inside until Monday morning, when a lift operator found him. He is now in hospital and is being treated for dehydration and back pain. His family members initially thought he was at work, but later contacted police and began a desperate search for him.The incident has made headlines, prompting the state government to suspend three technicians and launch an inquiry. Officials from the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, and the state\'s health minister have apologised to Mr Nair.Mr Nair told the BBC that when he got trapped, he tried calling the emergency number listed in the lift but there was no response. He also tried calling his wife Sreelekha CP, who works at the hospital, and ""anyone else I could think of"", but the calls wouldn\'t connect.""I began panicking and started banging on the lift doors to attract attention. That’s when my phone fell on the floor and stopped working,"" he says.""I shouted and screamed for help and tried pulling apart the doors with my hands. It was now dark inside the lift, but thankfully, there was sufficient air to breathe.""He then paced around the lift, pressing the alarm bell again and again, hoping it would ring and catch someone\'s attention - but without any success. ""As the hours passed, I had no idea whether it was day or night as it was pitch dark inside. When I got tired, I slept in a corner. I had to use another corner to pee and poo,"" he says.', 'Mr Nair said he began visiting the hospital regularly a few months ago after he fell in the bathroom and started suffering from back pain.""On Saturday, my wife and I went to meet the doctor and I got an X-ray scan done of my back because I was experiencing severe pain after a recent trip,"" he recalls. When the doctor asked to see the results from his blood test, the couple realised that they had forgotten them at home. Since Ms Sreelakha had to report for work, Mr Nair went home to pick up the results. Normally when he visits the hospital he and his wife use a lift earmarked for employees. But this time he stepped into Lift-11 - meant for patients and visitors - to head up to the second floor. ""It was just past noon then. There was no-one else in the lift but the light was on, so I didn\'t think anything was wrong,"" he says.He pressed the button and the lift began ascending but as it neared the second floor, it lurched downwards with a thud and got stuck between the first and second floors.He didn\'t know then that his ordeal would last nearly two days. At some point he remembered he had to take pills to keep his blood pressure under control. ""I had them on me, but couldn’t swallow them because I had no water and my mouth was dry from shouting for help,"" he recalls.""I started wondering whether I would die inside the lift. I worried about my wife and children and thought about my late parents and ancestors. But then, I somehow willed myself to be stronger and told myself that I had to overcome this frightening ordeal.""One thing that gave him comfort, he says, was reciting poems written by his wife. ""I held on to the hope that someone would come along to repair the lift and find me there.""Help arrived finally on Monday morning at around 06:00 local time when an operator opened the door and asked him to jump out - 42 hours after his ordeal began.Once Mr Nair was rescued, the first thing he did was call his wife, who had no idea her missing husband was trapped at her workplace.""He wanted me to come and take him home,"" she says.The hospital has since put up a warning outside the lift asking people not to use it while it is being repaired.']"

If this conflict escalates to all-out war, it could dwarf the destruction in Gaza, draw in Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, spread embers around the Middle East and embroil the US. Iran itself could intervene directly.The United Nations has warned of a “catastrophe beyond imagination”.For now, a low-level war simmers in the summer heat, along a 120km (75 mile) stretch of border. One spark here could set the Middle East alight.', 'Over the lapping of the waves, and the thwack thwack of paddle games on the beach, a sound cuts through - a sudden deep boom.Soon smoke billows from a hillside in the distance after an Israeli strike.Around the pool in a resort hotel, a few sunbathers stand briefly to scan the horizon.Others don’t move a tanned limb.Explosions are part of the sound of summer 2024 in the ancient Lebanese city of Tyre, as Hezbollah and Israel exchange fire across the border 25 kilometres (15 miles) away.“Another day, another bomb,” says Roland, 49, with a shrug, as he relaxes on a lilo. He lives abroad but is back home on holiday.“We got used to it somehow over the months,” says his friend Mustafa, 39, “though children are still a little bit scared.” He nods towards his daughter Miral, 7, who is dripping wet from the pool.“When she hears an explosion, she always asks, ‘will there be a bomb now?’” he says.', 'Earlier this month, there was a massive blast in his neighbourhood in Tyre, as his family of four were having a meal. Israel had assassinated a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Nimah Nasser.“We heard the noise,” Mustafa says, “and we carried on eating.”But the sunbathers on the beach in Tyre may be on borrowed time. This city will be in the firing line in the event of all-out war, along with the rest of southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah stronghold.We are now at the water’s edge of a potentially devastating war which both sides say they don’t want. Iran doesn’t seem to want it either.How did we get here?', 'On October 8th last year – one day after Hamas gunmen stormed out of Gaza and killed about 1,200 Israelis as well as taking 251 others hostage – Hezbollah joined in, firing at Israeli targets from Lebanon.The Shia Islamist armed group said it was acting in support of Gaza.Soon Israel was firing back.Hezbollah, which is also a political party, is the most powerful force in Lebanon.Like Hamas, it is classed as a terrorist organisation by many countries, including the UK and the US.But unlike Hamas, Hezbollah has the firepower to seriously threaten Israel.It is believed to have an arsenal of more than 150,000 rockets and missiles - some precision-guided - capable of inflicting heavy damage around the country.What is Hezbollah in Lebanon and will it go to war with Israel?Put simply Hezbollah - its English translation, the Party of God - has more arms than many countries.Its backer Iran – which denies Israel’s right to exist – is happy to train and fund the enemies of the Jewish state.The conflict has been heating up, with thousands of cross-border strikes.Some countries have already told their nationals to leave Lebanon urgently, including Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and Saudi Arabia. The UK has advised against all travel to the country and is urging Britons who are here to leave - while they still can.So far, both sides are mainly striking military targets, close to the border -  staying within familiar red lines.', 'But here on the Lebanese side, we have seen destruction in civilian areas with scorched fields, flattened houses and abandoned villages.And the current tit-for-tat has already driven tens of thousands from their homes - more than 90,000 in Lebanon and about 60,000 in Israel.Israeli officials say 33 people have been killed so far in Hezbollah attacks, mostly soldiers.Lebanon’s losses are far higher at 466, according to the Ministry of Health here. Most of the dead were fighters.Sally Skaiki was not.', '“I never called her Sally,” says her father Hussein Abdul Hassan Skaiki. “I always called her ‘my life’ - she was everything for me.”“She was the only girl in the house, and we spoiled her, me and her three brothers.”Sally, 25, was a volunteer paramedic. She was killed by an Israeli strike after sunset on 14 June as she stood in the doorway of her building.Her father wears the black of mourning, and the green scarf of the Shia Amal movement, which is allied to Hezbollah.', 'We meet in his village of Deir Qanoun En-Naher, 30km (18 miles) from the border. The main road is dotted with sun-bleached posters of fighters killed in battle against Israel - some in recent months, others back in 2006 when the two sides last went to war.In that conflict, Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill but at huge cost to Lebanon and its people. There was massive destruction, and more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians were killed - according to official figures - along with an unconfirmed number of Hezbollah fighters.Israel’s death toll was 160, according to the government, most of them soldiers.By Hussein’s side there is a large poster of Sally, in her headscarf and paramedic uniform. He speaks of his daughter with pride and with anguish.“She loved to help people,” he says. “Any problem that happened, she rushed there. She was well-loved in the village. She always had a smile on her face.”As we speak there is a loud boom which rattles the windows.Hussein says it is a normal, daily occurrence.“Since a long time, Israel killed our people here,” he says.“We can’t forgive them. There is no hope of peace with them.”This time, there is no death or destruction. Instead, Israeli warplanes are breaking the sound barrier to spread fear.And, since October, Israel has been spreading something else in southern Lebanon - choking, searing clumps of white phosphorus, contained in munitions.', 'The chemical substance ignites immediately on contact with oxygen. It sticks to skin and clothing and can burn through bone, according to the World Health Organization.Moussa al-Moussa - a farmer stooped by his 77 years - knows only too well.He says Israel fired white phosphorous shells at his land in the village of al-Bustan every day for over a month, robbing him of breath, and his livelihood.“I had my scarf on, and I wrapped it around my mouth and nose until I was brought to the hospital,” he tells me, gesturing to the red and white keffiyeh – the traditional Arab scarf - on his head.“We didn’t have any masks.  I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t see a metre in front of me. And if you touch a fragment a week later it will ignite and burn again.”The international campaign group, Human Rights Watch, has verified the use of white phosphorus over several populated areas in southern Lebanon, including al-Bustan.It says Israel’s use of white phosphorus is “unlawfully indiscriminate in populated areas”.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) dispute this, saying the use of white phosphorus shells to create a smokescreen “is lawful under international law”.  It says these shells are not used in densely populated areas “with certain exceptions”.', 'Like many farmers along the border, Moussa fears Israel has poisoned his tobacco crop and his olive groves.“White phosphorous burns the ground, it burns people and the crops and buildings,” he says.Even if he can return home, he is afraid to bring in a harvest in case it harms his family or his buyers.He lives in limbo - in classroom 4B of a vocational school in Tyre. About 30 families who fled the border area are sheltering in the building. Washing is strung across the school yard. A lone little boy races up and down the empty corridors on a bicycle.When I ask Moussa how many wars he has seen, he begins to laugh.“We spent our lives in wars,” he says. “Only God knows if another one is coming.”', 'As one of Hezbollah’s most senior commanders, Mohammed Nimah Nasser, was a wanted man. He fought Israel in 2006, and before, and went on to fight in Syria and Iraq. In recent months he “planned, led and supervised many military operations against the Israeli enemy”, according to Hezbollah.Israel tracked him down in Tyre on 3 July. Death came from the sky in broad daylight, with an air strike which turned his car into a fireball.In the Hezbollah stronghold of south Beirut, he was given a hero’s funeral, or rather a “martyr’s” one.The event was carefully choreographed and strictly segregated - men in one area, women in another - including the press.His coffin, draped in the yellow flag of Hezbollah, was carried by pall bearers in camouflage uniforms and red berets. Many more fighters stood to attention, lines deep. There was a brass band in spotless white uniforms, if not in perfect harmony.It had the feel of a state funeral - in a country that lacks a functioning state.Lebanon has no president, a caretaker government and a shattered economy. It is carved up by sect, and hollowed out by corruption, its citizens left to fend for themselves. Many Lebanese are weary. The last thing they want is another war.But as the funeral prayers concluded, the talk among mourners was of “martyrdom” not death, and of readiness for war, if it comes.', 'Hassan Hamieh, a 35-year-old nurse, told us he would fight. “We are not afraid,” he said.“In fact, we are longing for an all-out war. Martyrdom is the shortest path to God. Young or old, we will all take part in this war, if it is forced upon us.”Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has stressed the armed group is ready, but not eager, for war. He says if there is a ceasefire agreed in Gaza, Hezbollah will cease fire too, immediately.Will that satisfy Israel? Maybe not.It sees Hezbollah as a permanent threat too close for comfort. At the very least, it wants its heavily armed enemy to pull back from the border.There have been plenty of bellicose threats. Israel’s Education Minister, Yoav Kish, said Lebanon would be “annihilated”. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant chimed in, saying the country would be returned “to the stone age”.As the attacks and counter attacks continue, families are destroyed. This month parents have been ripped from children, and children from parents.An Israeli couple were killed in their car by Hezbollah rockets as they headed for home in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria. They left behind three teenage children. And in southern Lebanon three children were killed in an Israeli strike earlier this week. They were aged between four and eight, and their parents were Syrian farm workers.The IDF approved “operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon” a month ago.For now, no tanks are rolling over the border. There has been no political decision to attack. Israel is still waging war in Gaza and fighting on two fronts could overstretch the military.But without a diplomatic solution between Israel and Hezbollah - two old enemies - all-out war may be coming, if not now, then later.Additional reporting by Goktay Koraltan and Ghassan Ibraheem']"

""People cut corners and when you try to raise alarm, some feel that you are trying to victimise or oppress them. They use their people in positions of authority to circumvent the rules.""', 'Following the building collapse at Saints Academy, the local governor has ordered a structural audit of all schools and public buildings in Plateau state, of which Jos is the capital. Officials in his government say it is not clear whether the school’s owner, who has since died, ever had a construction permit for the site.The BBC was unable to get comment from the school\'s management.Some also suspect that mining activity close by could have damaged the school building, so the governor has also ordered the arrest of any artisanal miners found digging in residential areas in the state.But officials suspect that the main problem was with how the school was built.""Even as a layman who is not a building professional, you can see that the materials used in the construction are not standard. But we will investigate the cause of the collapse and punish those found culpable,"" Musa Ashom, the state Commissioner for Information, tells the BBC.Similar promises came from Nigeria\'s Housing Minister, Ahmed Dangiwa, who spoke scathingly of ""unscrupulous"" individuals whose actions he said had resulted in the Jos school collapse and caused unquantifiable loss.But those words will come as little consolation to the many bereft families, like that of Chinecherem Joy Emeka.The 13-year-old was one of the best dancers at her school and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day, says her mother Blessing Nwabuchi.Chinecherem, or Chi Chi as loved ones called her, was sitting her end-of-year exams the day she died.Photos like this one, from her junior high graduation last year, are precious reminders of what she achieved - and everything she might have gone on to become.', ""Should I stay or should I go?

Kenya's ‘serial killer’ mystery - five key questions,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19k0zj1dw3o#3,"Still reeling from the discovery of bodies in a quarry, Kenyans are trying to find out more.","Tue, 16 Jul 2024 23:58:35 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.589695,"['The arrest of an alleged serial killer in Kenya has shocked the country - but many have serious questions about the circumstances of his arrest.Police say Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, confessed to killing 42 women - though his lawyer told a court on Tuesday he was tortured into a confession.It is the latest twist in a perplexing story that followed the recent discovery of the dismembered remains of nine bodies wrapped in plastic at a disused quarry, which is used as rubbish tip and is close to a police post in the capital, Nairobi.', ""Many people are finding it hard to understand that the police were unable to detect that bodies were being left around 100m (109 yards) from one of their offices in the informal settlement of Mukuru Kwa Njenga.Residents have criticised officers for their “laxity and unprofessionalism” in dealing with the crime.In response, acting police chief Douglas Kanja announced on Sunday that the officers from Kware police post near the scene had been transferred.It is not clear whether they have been questioned over how the deaths went unnoticed.But given the force's poor human rights record, the police watchdog said it was undertaking a preliminary investigation to establish whether there was any police connection."", 'What is even more baffling is how a member of the public came to discover them.The family of Josephine Owino, who had gone missing, says she came to one of them ""in a dream"" and helped point them in the right direction.Diana Keya, Ms Owino’s cousin, told Citizen TV that the family then paid some young men near the rubbish tip to comb through the debris.That was how nine severely mutilated bodies were found on Friday. They were wrapped in nylon bags, which were tied with rope.The first statement by police said the “alarm was raised” by the public.When questioned later the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations Mohamed Amin said: “We are not dreamers and we do not believe in dreams.”', ""Police said the bodies recovered were in different stages of decomposition, suggesting that the victims had been killed at different times.In the now-disputed confession, the police say Mr Khalusha allegedly admitted to murdering the women over a period of two years.What is not clear, though, is whether the remains had been dumped over that time or more recently.Hussein Khalid, the executive director of rights group Haki Africa, told the BBC that the police's version of events had “a lot of loopholes”."", 'After not apparently suspecting anything for two years the police then made an arrest in less than three days after the discovery of the bodies.On Monday, police said Mr Khalusha was detained at a bar in the small hours of that morning while watching the Euro final football match.They displayed to the media some of the items said to have been recovered from the suspect’s house - also close to where the bodies were found - including 10 phones, a laptop, identity cards and personal female clothing.The police said they had traced Mr Khalusha’s whereabouts after geo-locating the mobile phone of one of his alleged victims.Mr Khalusha’s lawyer has questioned the validity of the evidence.', 'Only one body has been identified so far - that of 24-year-old Roseline Ongogo.Her brother Emmanuel Ongogo told the BBC she went missing on 28 June after she left the house to look for casual work.He said the family went to the morgue when they heard bodies had been recovered from Mukuru.They identified her as she in the same clothes she had disappeared wearing and had the same hairstyle.', ""The police also allege that Mr Khalusha's wife was his first victim and say her identity card was found among the belongings of other alleged victims.The family of Ms Owino, who said they dreamt about her whereabouts, told the BBC they were still waiting for an identification."", ""The discovery has brought back memories of the brutal murder of 20-year-old Rita Waeni in January.Her dismembered body was found at a short-term rental apartment in Nairobi. The case is yet to be solved.The death triggered nationwide demonstrations against the rising cases of femicide and other violence against women.Amnesty International said more than 500 cases of femicide were recorded in Kenya between 2016 and 2023.All the bodies recovered from the rubbish tip are female. A handful of elected women leaders who converged at morgue asked the government to speed up the investigations and put an end to such violence.When asked what the police were doing to address cases of femicide and violence against women, spokesperson Resila Onyango said she could not address that issue specifically - but she told the BBC that the work of the police was “to protect life and property of everyone”.This scrutiny of the police comes as more Kenyan officers arrive in Haiti, where they are leading an international mission to tackle the country's powerful gangs. Lobby groups in Port-au-Prince have previously questioned the credibility of the officers over claims of brutality and extra-judicial killings, which Kenya's government has always denied."", 'Kenya protesters traumatised by abductions - lawyer‘We are the Church’: Kenyan tax protesters take on Christian leadersKenyan cult leader charged with 191 murders', 'Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica']"

New tech aims to keep polar bears and people apart,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cljy48yj99wo#3,Fears about the two species coming into contact are growing as Arctic sea ice melts.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 23:40:43 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:07.590318,"[""At the end of the Canadian Arctic summer, polar bears head inland to wait for the ice to form.   And while thousands of tourists  flock to catch a glimpse of these magnificent predators, researchers are developing novel ways to keep people and bears safely separated.  New tracking devices that stick in polar bears’ fur could be the key to protecting both people and bears - by closely monitoring the animals' locations.Polar bears now spend more of the year on land, as Arctic sea ice melts, so conservationists are increasingly concerned about bears and people coming into contact.The tracking tags, which have been tested on bears in Canadian Arctic, could help prevent those encounters, by “keeping a remote eye” on the bears."", 'Lead researcher Tyler Ross, a PhD candidate from York University in Toronto, said the fur tags were “particularly promising” for the prevention of these “human-bear interactions”.In communities in the southern Canadian Arctic, where the scientists tested these tags, polar bears that wander too close to a community are sometimes caught, transported and released in carefully selected sites away from towns and villages. “These tags could be fitted to those bears to monitor where they are after they\'ve been released,” explained Mr Ross.“If they\'re coming back towards the community, conservation staff would have a sense of where they are, and they could head them off. I think that\'s where they offer considerable promise.""The researcher, who studies polar bear ecology, also says the tags could fill important gaps in knowledge about the bears. And as the Arctic climate warms up rapidly, the need to monitor bears becomes increasingly urgent.', ""“There's a dearth of information about male polar bear movements, because they can't be equipped with conventional tracking collars,” said Mr Ross.The sea ice [that the polar bears use as a platform from which to hunt] is disappearing faster than it has in the past,” explained Mr Ross. “So the winter hunting season is getting shorter. We want to know where they're moving in response.”Polar bears are difficult to tag. Male bears’ heads are smaller than their necks, so tracking collars can just slip off.Another option is ear tags - attached by piercing the bear’s ear. They require an animal to be recaptured in order to remove the tag and, in rare cases, can injure the ear.The three new tags the researchers tested were designed by the company 3M in collaboration with the charity Polar Bears International. They all attach to the bears’ coarse fur.To fit the tags, scientists had to locate and sedate bears. They then assessed the quality of the data they received from each device and noted when the tags fell off."", 'The best performing device was called a SeaTrkr tag, which is “crimped” into the bears’ fur. It stayed attached for an average of 58 days and  - with an in-built GPS system - allowed the scientists to pinpoint the bears’ location to within just a few metres.“It’s ideal to have something that falls off naturally - that’s not permanently  attached to the bear,” explained Mr Ross. “But anything that lasts in the order of a few months would be great [for our research], because then you’re getting these important seasons that the bears are going through throughout the year.”Climate change is bringing bears and humans into closer proximity, making places where polar bears and people coexist, riskier for both.One  US Geological Survey study in 2022 that that used data from satellite tracking collars on more than 400 polar bears in Alaska, shows the time they spend onshore has grown significantly in recent decades.“Getting a better sense of polar bears’ movements is really crucial,” Mr Ross commented. “Particularly given the state of their environment at this point.”This study of the bear tags is published in the journal Animal Biotelemetry.

Votes for 16-year-olds fails to make King's Speech,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd09l31rrjo#0,Commons leader Lucy Powell says the measure remains a Labour commitment for the current parliament. ,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 13:38:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.882855,"['Labour\'s manifesto pledge to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 in UK general elections has not been included in the King\'s Speech. But Commons leader Lucy Powell told the BBC votes for 16 and 17-year-olds remained a commitment, and she hoped they would be able to vote in the next general election.Forcing members of the House of Lords to retire at the age of 80 was another pledge which did not make the cut when King Charles read out the new government\'s planned laws for the new parliamentary session. During the recent election campaign, the Conservatives accused Labour of trying to ""distort the political system"" to entrench itself in power.   ', 'Then-Home Secretary James Cleverly warned that measures like extending the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds were an attempt by Labour to ""lock in their power permanently, because they don\'t really feel confident they\'re going to be able to make a credible case to the British people at the next election"".Pressed on Radio 5 Live on why lowering the voting age had not featured in this  King\'s Speech, Ms Powell said there were ""plenty of big bills that didn’t make it into this"".  An elections bill would come later in the parliamentary cycle, she promised, adding:  ""It\'s absolutely a manifesto commitment."" Asked if 16 and 17-year-olds would be able to vote in the next general election, she said: ""I hope so. That\'s the intention.""

That was intended to be only a short-term compromise, but the arrangements have persisted for 25 years. The King indicated that further constitutional changes were likely later in the parliamentary cycle.The government would ""strengthen the integrity of elections and encourage wide participation in the democratic process"", he said.  Alex Norris, a minister in the housing, communities and local government department, posted on X: ""Too many people feel their voice is not being heard in our democracy, with millions of legitimate voters still not registered to vote.""This Government will restore faith in politics. From introducing votes at 16 to handing power back to communities with our English Devolution Bill, we will give those who contribute to our country a say in how it is governed."" The UK voting age was last lowered in 1969 - from 21 to 18 - by Harold Wilson\'s Labour government. The age was reduced to 16 for elections in Scotland - by the Scottish Parliament - in 2015.

Falling clothes prices help keep inflation rate steady,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck7gzllwlmlo#0,"The cost of living rose at 2% in the year to June, in line with the Bank of England's target.","Wed, 17 Jul 2024 08:57:09 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.883108,"['UK inflation held steady in June, remaining at the Bank of England\'s target rate of 2%, according to the latest official figures.Discounts on clothes in summer sales helped offset the soaring cost of hotel stays.Overall, inflation rose at 2% in the year to June, unchanged from May.It means that the cost of living is still rising but at a rate that the central bank is comfortable with, after nearly three years of above-target inflation which has squeezed household finances.The latest figures showed clothing and footwear costs fell last month, while food and drink inflation has dropped sharply from the highs of recent years.Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), told the BBC\'s Today programme that there was a ""higher level of discounting"".The figures also showed that second-hand car costs fell but by less than the same time last year.Prices in restaurants and hotels rose more than a year ago though, putting some upward pressure on the headline inflation rate. ', 'Hotel prices jumped by 8.8% compared with the previous month, the ONS said, whereas prices in restaurants and cafes went up by 0.3% on a monthly basis.The figures also showed the costs of package holidays, cinemas, theatres and concerts were rising.', 'However, in areas like services, which include everything from restaurants to hairdressers, price increases remain persistent.That could raise questions for Bank of England policymakers over when they should begin to cut interest rates.Darren Jones, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, said that families\' budgets across Britain were still being squeezed.""We face the legacy of 14 years of chaos and economic irresponsibility. That is why this government is taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off.""The Bank\'s base rate - which is used to help set mortgage rates and other borrowing costs - currently stands at a 16-year-high of 5.25% after it was increased in a bid to tackle soaring inflation.Its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which votes to set the rate, has held interest rates at this level for several months but some economists have predicted they will cut the rate at the next vote on 1 August.Leanne Morgan and her husband Gareth bought their house in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2016 when interest rates were much lower. Their five-year fixed mortgage deal came to an end this month and their new rate stands at just over 4% - pushing their mortgage payments up by £5,200 a year. ', 'Mrs Morgan said the higher mortgage payments had restricted the things they were able to do with their three older children.""We can\'t have family holidays, we\'ve not been able to do so much with the children... it affects where I shop for food, I’m always looking for discounts. We sit together, we look at what our costs are, where we can cut back and look at a budget.""She said she was optimistic, however, that the UK economy was over the worst and that better times were ahead.""I think sometimes the doom and gloom that we talk about can actually make us feel very negative,"" she said.""But if we have a good conversation about what is possible, and working with what we\'ve got, we can have a better conversation about it.""The overall inflation rate has fallen sharply since October 2022, when it peaked at 11.1%. But some of the underlying measures of inflation being watched closely by the Bank of England remain stubbornly high. Inflation in the services sector, for example, remained at 5.7% in June, while core inflation, which strips out the effects of more volatile items like energy prices, held at 3.5%. ', 'Alongside some other stronger figures for the economy in recent days, it may give some pause for thought for members of the Bank of England committee deciding interest rates next month. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund listed the UK among countries who might need to keep interest rates ""higher for even longer"" than originally anticipated to squeeze inflation out of the system.Markets have been anticipating that rate cuts will start on 1 August, helping fixed mortgage rates fall. The latest numbers suggest it will be a finely balanced decision.On Wednesday investors pared back bets on a rate cut taking place, saying there was about a 35% chance - down from just under 50% before the data was published.Separately, fresh official figures on the housing market helped give an insight into the costs facing both buyers and renters.They show the rate at which UK rents are rising is close to a record high, hitting 8.6% in the 12 months to June. The pace of the increase slowed very slightly on the previous month but remains well above the norm of the last 15 years or so.House prices also rose by 2.2% in the year to May, the ONS said, with the average price of a home in England now above £300,000.']"

Amazon workers narrowly reject union in historic vote,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vd72zrpr1o#1,If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. ,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:05:05 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.883800,"['The GMB has narrowly lost its historic bid for union recognition at the Amazon warehouse in Coventry. Some 49.5% of workers balloted voted in favour, while 50.5% voted against. The union needed a majority to vote in favour.If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. The online giant would have been forced to negotiate with workers on issues such as pay and conditions.In a statement, Amazon said it placed ""enormous value on engaging directly"" with staff.""We look forward to continuing on that path with our team in Coventry,"" it added.The GMB told the BBC it is considering trying again to get recognition at the Coventry site and that discussions are taking place about its strategy. The process would include persuading the Central Arbitration Committee, which is in charge of overseeing applications for recognition, that the pool of workers eligible to vote had changed.', 'The GMB, which lost by 28 votes, said its drive for recognition fell “agonisingly short” and accused Amazon of “union-busting”.It said there were “anti-union messages by company bosses, including multiple anti-union seminars” at the warehouse.It added that “the fire lit by workers in Coventry and across the UK is still burning”, and that the union would “carry on the fight”  for low paid workers.', ""The union's fight for recognition had been described as a David vs Goliath battle, with workers facing fierce resistance from the online giant.It began with a rag tag show of defiance in the summer of 2022, after Amazon offered workers a pay rise of between 35p and 50p an hour. Having toiled in warehouses during the Covid pandemic, workers said this felt like an insult, and in Coventry a small group of angry workers spontaneously walked out and protested outside the fulfilment centre. Then the GMB got involved and urged the workforce to unionise.In January 2023, with a GMB membership of just 50, Coventry workers held the first ever Amazon strike in the UK. "", 'It went on to organise a further 37 days of industrial action over the last year and by recruiting on the picket line, steadily built up its membership to more than 1,400 members out of the centre\'s estimated 3,000 plus workers.In April the union launched a legal challenge against Amazon, claiming it used underhand tactics to encourage members to cancel their union membership.On Wednesday it said that legal challenge would continue. As part of the challenge, the GMB says Amazon put up posters in fulfilment centres featuring QR codes that generated an email to the union’s membership department requesting that their membership be cancelled.Amazon responded saying that “employees were telling us they wanted to cancel their membership but could not find a way to do so, so we provided information to help. ""We have always been clear, that union membership is an employee’s personal choice.”', 'Amazon, which is one of the UK\'s largest private sector employers, with 75,000 workers, made it clear all along that it did not want to recognise a union and that it wanted to retain direct communication with its staff. After the vote on Wednesday, it further reiterated that “having daily conversations” with staff was “an essential part of our work culture”.“We value that direct relationship and so do our employees. This is why we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, act on their feedback, and invest heavily in great pay, benefits and skills development,"" the firm added.The GMB says it is surprised by what it sees as the fearlessness of an overwhelmingly immigrant workforce, many of whom arrived recently from South Asia. Union organisers estimate that as little as 5% of the Coventry employees are British born and its campaign leaflets were translated into 12 different languages. They say that in the beginning many were frightened to get involved but as the strikes wore on, and people saw that workers who’d joined picket lines weren’t facing disciplinary action, their confidence grew.The union is hopeful that the government will strengthen their power to organise. Labour has promised legislation in today\'s King\'s Speech to make it easier for unions to win recognition ballots by lowering the required threshold for victory and to make it easier for union officials to recruit in workplaces.', 'The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said that despite taking on one of the ""world\'s largest corporate giants"", the Coventry union members ""only narrowly missed out"" on securing recognition.""With Labour set to usher in a new era of stronger workers’ rights, companies like Amazon are on the wrong side of history,"" he added.But Gregor Gall, a professor of industrial relations at Glasgow university, questioned whether GMB had the resources to take the fight to other Amazon centres.""The cost of union organising is very high. The GMB had officers working full time on it. We won\'t necessarily see organising drives elsewhere,"" he said.Professor Gall\'s caution is understandable considering what has happened in the United States. In 2022 Amazon workers at its Staten Island warehouse in New York became the first in the US to win union recognition. Two years on, the company has still not sat down to negotiate with the union and continues to fight legal challenges to the vote.']"

The BBC understands he took his own life.A fatal accident inquiry - which is mandatory for any death in custody - will be held to examine the circumstances.A prison service spokesperson said: “Every death, whether in prison custody or in our communities, is a tragedy for all those who knew and supported the individual.“Following the death of someone in our care, Police Scotland are advised, and the matter reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Fatal accident inquiries are held in due course.”The 17-year-old was sent to Polmont after pleading guilty to a charge of acting in a disorderly manner and being in possession of weapons with intent to ""assault and murder"" a 16-year-old girl.He had put an airgun, shovel, wrench, duct tape and rope in the boot of a car as he went looking for the girl in Moray in March last year.While the case was ongoing, he stayed in a secure children’s unit before being moved to Polmont.Police Scotland said officers had been made aware of the death of a 17-year-old at Polmont and it was not thought to be suspicious.', 'The Scottish government said in March 2022 that 16 and 17-year-olds would no longer be placed in young offenders institutions.It said it wanted to end the placement of under-18s in custody ""without delay"", and pledged to fund ""care-based alternatives"" and shift the approach from ""one of punishment to one of love and support"".The announcement came after Scotland\'s chief inspector of prisons, Wendy Sinclair-Gieben, said sending 16 and 17-year-olds to Polmont - especially those who had not yet been convicted - was a breach of their human rights.The Children (Care and Justice) (Scotland) Bill - which sets out that children under the age of 18 will no longer be sent to prison - received Royal Assent last month and became an act of parliament.Separate legislation passed by Holyrood to incorporate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) came into force on Tuesday.As of 12 July, there were nine 16 to 17-year-olds held in custody at Polmont. Six were untried, two had been sentenced and one had been awaiting sentencing.', 'Wendy Sinclair-Gieben told BBC Scotland News, the “intent” to remove children from prisons in Scotland was there, but the speed at which it was being achieved was “not great”.She told BBC News: ""There should be no more children in prison. I don’t think Polmont is a good place for children.”Minister for Victims and Community Safety Siobhian Brown, said every death in custody was a tragedy and that the government was working to end the placement of under-18s in young offenders institutions.She said: ""We are working with the Scottish Prison Service and secure accommodation providers to commence these provisions shortly. The decision on whether to detain a child remains with the independent judiciary.”', ""A joint fatal accident inquiry (FAI) was held earlier this year into the deaths of Katie Allan, 21, and William Brown, 16, who both took their own lives at Polmont within months of each other in 2018. Katie, a geography student at Glasgow University, was jailed for16 months for drink-driving after hitting a 15-year-old boy, who was knocked unconscious.William, also known as William Lindsay, who had never been convicted of a crime, had only been sent to Polmont because a place could not be found for him in a secure children's unit.A separate FAI was also recently held into the death of Jack McKenzie, who took his own life at Polmont on 3 September 2021.He had been on remand at Polmont for rape and sexual assault charges - which he denied - since January of that year."", 'Katie Allan’s mother, Linda Allan told BBC Scotland she is “devastated” for Jonathan Beadle\'s family but she is not surprised to hear about the latest death in Polmont.""The only thing that surprises me is that not more young people are dying,"" she said.Ms Allan has previously criticised the ""inadequacies of the prison suicide strategy, which apparently ignores evidence"" and ""the flawed system of relying on prisoners self-reporting suicide ideation"".Sheriff Simon Collins, who heard both inquiries, is expected to make recommendations for change when he delivers his determination into the circumstances of all three deaths later in the year.The purpose of an FAI is to establish whether the deaths could have been prevented.It will also examine what precautions could be taken in future to try and stop young people from taking their own lives in prison.']"

Opposition parties have called for the first minister to fill the roles vacated.Meanwhile Wales\' previous first minister Mark Drakeford has said that Mr Gething was ""haunted"" by decisions he took which he has never been able to shake off.Mark Drakeford said the outgoing Welsh Labour leader was ""dogged"" by decisions taken over campaign donations and the sacking of a minister.Another former holder of Wales\' top job, Alun Michael, said Mr Gething had been ""forced out"".', 'Mr Miles came second in the leadership contest in March with 48.3% of the vote, versus Mr Gething\'s 51.7%.Since the result he moved from the job of education minister to economy secretary under the new first minister.He had declined to give a view on the £200,000 donation from a controversial waste company, whose owner had been previously convicted of environmental offences, during the campaign itself - but a month later said he would not have accepted the money.On Monday, a day before his resignation, he repeatedly failed to support Mr Gething in an interview.In his letter to the first minister outlining why he was quitting, Mr Miles said: ""The events of the last few months including you loss of the confidence vote in the Senedd have been incredibly painful.""This has become a distraction from the important work of the Welsh government and is damaging our party"".Dates for the contest are yet to be set, although Mr Gething has said his replacement would be installed by the autumn.', 'But two supporters of the first minister have told BBC Wales that Mr Miles\' involvement in forcing Mr Gething\'s exit makes him unsuitable to take over.One Gething supporter suggested they would rather ""die in a ditch"" than have Mr Miles as leader of the party.They said they would like to see Eluned Morgan run, saying she was a communicator who could connect the party with traditional backers of Labour.Another supporter said Mr Miles could not unite the party and there was ""a very strong feeling that the person who is associated with a bloodied knife cannot claim the crown"".They added: ""I\'m really worried about what this says to the world, to people in the United Kingdom and especially in Wales who are not white.""It looks like a bunch of people have drawn daggers and knifed Vaughan without giving him a chance. I do find that really difficult to deal with.""In a response, a backer of Mr Miles said: “The people who did their best to block Jeremy last time are up to their old tricks, it seems. Let the members decide.""Mr Miles had more nominations from Labour Senedd members than Mr Gething last year, with 16 versus Mr Gething\'s ten.', 'A separate Miles supporter said it was not ""credible"" for Mr Gething to carry on through the summer as he no longer had the support of ""the group, cabinet or Senedd"".

BBC News went to Rothwell to find out what residents think about the statistic.', 'An industrial estate at one end, and at the other, a quaint 19th Century Anglican church and pub. In the mile and a bit between these local landmarks are more than 300 homes.Wood Lane, in the south Leeds suburb of Rothwell, is like many other UK streets of its kind, with bus stops, a bakery, shops, a hairdresser and other day-to-day amenities. But burglaries on this street and the surrounding area have gone unsolved.', 'Research for Channel 4\'s Dispatches suggests that 56 break-ins had occurred in an area known as Rothwell Outer, none of which had resulted in a conviction.   West Yorkshire Police says its burglary detection rates are in-line with other parts of the country, but that some offences were unsolved because of a lack of evidence.It says the figures quoted in the programme were solely for 2021 and involved break-ins to some homes but were mostly non-dwelling burglaries from places such as sheds and garages.One victim of burglary is Amanda, who has lived around here for 15 years. Her home was raided last winter, with thieves stealing cash and jewellery. She says the police were ""great"" in their initial rapid response to the incident, though she has been left in the dark since. ""They did everything they could do in the first instance,"" Amanda explains. ""They came out straight away and you had investigators come out to assess the scene within a matter of hours. ""In terms of anything since, we just presume nothing has happened because we have not heard anything. ""Then again, I don\'t really know what to expect because this has never happened to us before.""You just have to trust the police are doing what they can, and if they find the evidence they can link it to someone.""', 'Amanda suggests the geography of Wood Lane and surrounding streets, which feature an array of snickets, alleyways and side roads, may make the area potentially more attractive to burglars needing a quick getaway. Amanda says the incident did initially make her feel ""less safe"" but that she and her family have done what they can to make their home as secure as possible. She also says a local PCSO has knocked on the door in the months since, which she finds reassuring. But others are less complimentary about the police presence around here, even though the office of Rothwell\'s neighbourhood policing team sits nearby', 'Steve Sutton, who has lived on Wood Lane for 18 years, has not been a victim of burglary, but knows residents who have. ""It doesn\'t surprise me they haven\'t been solved,"" he says. ""The police presence is zero. You see them driving up and down very occasionally.""Steve says the burglaries make you ""a bit more conscious"" about what is going on, especially as he says some of the thefts have taken place during the day.But, he adds: ""Generally, in terms of other crime it\'s a decent area, to be fair.""', 'Long-serving Liberal Democrat councillor for the area Stewart Golton says there is ""frustration"" in the community, ""because there aren\'t enough police to respond to the issues that we\'ve got"". ""Those statistics about burglaries are not a surprise, because we encourage people to report crime and then it feels like the crime you do report doesn\'t get responded to,"" Mr Golton says. ""We appreciate it is hard to catch criminals once they have committed the crime but it would be nice to know there is least an attempt at doing so, because otherwise what is the deterrent for future criminals to not do it?""On the high street in Rothwell, about five miles south east of Leeds city centre, shoppers echo concerns about a lack of visible police presence and about anti-social behaviour. Quad bikes, a particular bugbear for many communities across West Yorkshire in recent years, are raised frequently as an issue. ', 'John Graham, who was himself a victim of an unsolved burglary more than a decade ago, says: ""They are going round in gangs and a lot of them are wearing balaclavas and masks now.""I have lived around here for 40 years and it has changed a lot - for the worse.""', 'Daniel Newton, 34, lives just a stone\'s throw from Rothwell town centre and says some of the quad bike issues are caused by young people riding in from nearby Middleton.But, he suggests, there is a vicious circle of some young offenders committing anti-social behaviour because society ignores them. ""I have found if you try to connect and engage with them, they engage with you in a reasonable way,"" he says.""But they become rebellious because no-one is really engaging with them and they feel like outsiders. ""So it becomes reciprocal.""', 'Chatting outside Morrisons on the main street are friends Mary Kiernan and Pat Firth. Ms Firth lives in nearby Lofthouse, but comes into Rothwell to shop. ""I haven\'t lived in Rothwell for 18 years, but when we did there was always a PCSO walking down here,"" she recalls.""When we lived here it was a lot different to what it is now. ""I can understand why people get edgy when there\'s young groups going around on quad bikes.""', 'West Yorkshire Police says it recognises ""the huge impact"" burglaries have on victims and has made ""significant investments"" to reduce burglaries, which have declined since 2019 in West Yorkshire. It adds: ""We are also committed to attending all home burglaries in line with recently published national guidance.""Some burglaries are finalised as unsolved because of a lack of evidence or because a suspect cannot be identified.""Our detection rates are relatively in-line with other police forces in England and Wales, but we continually work to improve the quality of burglary investigations by listening to feedback from victims, looking at new and improved ways of working and training, and upskilling our officers and staff.""Addressing the wider issues around neighbourhood policing, the force says: ""While Rothwell has some officers who work specifically within its community to provide a familiar presence for people, it does not have a set number of allocated officers and is part of a larger Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT), which covers the Leeds South area.""Police officers and staff who work within NPTs are deployed to the areas where they are needed the most, so communities can be provided with reassurance when they need it.""Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

EastEnders spiking story ‘important’ to raise awareness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72v8rv3jp1o#3,Molly Rainford's character Anna Knight is the victim of spiking in a new five-part web series.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 01:06:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:11.887541,"['EastEnders actress Molly Rainford says it\'s ""important"" for the soap to tackle spiking in a new experimental storyline.Her character Anna Knight stars in a new five-part mini series uploaded by the show\'s makers to social media.Called Spiked, it shows what happens to Anna when her drink gets spiked during a night out.The online shorts are accessible via a QR code displayed during the episode shown on BBC One on Tuesday night.Viewers who scan the image with their phones are taken to the five episodes and links to resources about spiking. Spiking is when someone puts alcohol or drugs into another person’s drink or body without their knowledge or consent.According to police, the majority of cases happen in public places such as bars and nightclubs.Although spiking is already illegal, its due to become a specific criminal offence under changes announced in the King\'s Speech, where the government announces its plans for the year ahead.MPs believe this will make it easier for police to respond to reports.', 'Symptoms of spiking can include memory loss, hallucinations and disorientation.EastEnders hopes to show viewers of the miniseries the symptoms through Anna\'s eyes as her night takes a turn for the worse.""I think it\'s so important that we show those signs,"" says Molly.The actress tells BBC Newsbeat it was ""really important"" for her to do her research to portray the experience accurately and highlight the symptoms.Molly also urges people to look out for their friends on nights out.""Are they acting differently? Is something not quite right?"" she says.', 'Molly hopes the series will create more awareness around spiking, and reach younger audiences online.""What better platform than social media to reach the people that it\'s directly affecting?"" Molly says.She adds she is constantly thinking about her safety on nights out. ""You have to kind of live in that bit of fear that it could happen and it\'s a real shame.""I’m lucky enough that I haven’t been spiked, but it shouldn’t be luck, it should be standard.""The effects of spiking are something Abbi Taylor, from Manchester, knows about all too well.""It was just the worst thing I\'ve experienced,"" she says.', 'Abbi, who\'s originally from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, says she realised she\'d been spiked as she got home from a day event two months ago.She describes the feeling as ""sheer panic"".""I started to notice my vision going blurry,"" she says. ""I started shaking, I was sweating."" As the effects grew stronger, Abbi says, she started to lose the ability to move her body.""I couldn\'t talk. If I tried to stand up - I\'d just collapse,"" she says.""It almost felt like I was trapped in this body that didn\'t feel like it was mine.""After having her drink spiked, Abbi says she no longer wants to go on nights out.Like Molly, she urges others to be alert to the signs.""If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone,"" she says.Dawn Dines, CEO of charity Stamp Out Spiking, which consulted on the EastEnders mini series, says ""education is key to preventing these incidents"".She hopes featuring the issue on EastEnders will ""inspire conversations"" that help to protect people.', 'The Metropolitan Police, which covers London, says 1,383 allegations of spiking were submitted in 2023 – an average of 26 allegations per week. It says reports increased by 13% in the last six months of 2023 compared with the same period the previous year.In 2023, the force made 70 arrests for spiking offences.Met Police Det Ch Supt Angela Craggs urged those who suspect they\'ve been spiked to come forward.Around the country, Samantha Millar, of the National Police Chiefs’ Council says, police forces have been ""working proactively"" to improve feelings of safety on nights out.""This includes regular, targeted patrols of busy town centres,"" Samantha says, adding that police also visit universities to raise awareness of spiking symptoms.The Home Office has said the law is part of the new Labour government\'s ""mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade"".The spiking law will apply in England and Wales.

That is why this government is taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off.""The Bank\'s base rate - which is used to help set mortgage rates and other borrowing costs - currently stands at a 16-year-high of 5.25% after it was increased in a bid to tackle soaring inflation.Its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which votes to set the rate, has held interest rates at this level for several months but some economists have predicted they will cut the rate at the next vote on 1 August.Leanne Morgan and her husband Gareth bought their house in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2016 when interest rates were much lower. Their five-year fixed mortgage deal came to an end this month and their new rate stands at just over 4% - pushing their mortgage payments up by £5,200 a year. ', 'Mrs Morgan said the higher mortgage payments had restricted the things they were able to do with their three older children.""We can\'t have family holidays, we\'ve not been able to do so much with the children... it affects where I shop for food, I’m always looking for discounts. We sit together, we look at what our costs are, where we can cut back and look at a budget.""She said she was optimistic, however, that the UK economy was over the worst and that better times were ahead.""I think sometimes the doom and gloom that we talk about can actually make us feel very negative,"" she said.""But if we have a good conversation about what is possible, and working with what we\'ve got, we can have a better conversation about it.""The overall inflation rate has fallen sharply since October 2022, when it peaked at 11.1%. But some of the underlying measures of inflation being watched closely by the Bank of England remain stubbornly high. Inflation in the services sector, for example, remained at 5.7% in June, while core inflation, which strips out the effects of more volatile items like energy prices, held at 3.5%. ', 'Alongside some other stronger figures for the economy in recent days, it may give some pause for thought for members of the Bank of England committee deciding interest rates next month. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund listed the UK among countries who might need to keep interest rates ""higher for even longer"" than originally anticipated to squeeze inflation out of the system.Markets have been anticipating that rate cuts will start on 1 August, helping fixed mortgage rates fall. The latest numbers suggest it will be a finely balanced decision.On Wednesday investors pared back bets on a rate cut taking place, saying there was about a 35% chance - down from just under 50% before the data was published.Separately, fresh official figures on the housing market helped give an insight into the costs facing both buyers and renters.They show the rate at which UK rents are rising is close to a record high, hitting 8.6% in the 12 months to June. The pace of the increase slowed very slightly on the previous month but remains well above the norm of the last 15 years or so.House prices also rose by 2.2% in the year to May, the ONS said, with the average price of a home in England now above £300,000.']"
Amazon workers narrowly reject union in historic vote,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vd72zrpr1o#0,If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. ,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 11:05:05 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.260383,"['The GMB has narrowly lost its historic bid for union recognition at the Amazon warehouse in Coventry. Some 49.5% of workers balloted voted in favour, while 50.5% voted against. The union needed a majority to vote in favour.If the GMB had won it would have been the first time Amazon recognised a union in the UK. The online giant would have been forced to negotiate with workers on issues such as pay and conditions.In a statement, Amazon said it placed ""enormous value on engaging directly"" with staff.""We look forward to continuing on that path with our team in Coventry,"" it added.The GMB told the BBC it is considering trying again to get recognition at the Coventry site and that discussions are taking place about its strategy. The process would include persuading the Central Arbitration Committee, which is in charge of overseeing applications for recognition, that the pool of workers eligible to vote had changed.', 'The GMB, which lost by 28 votes, said its drive for recognition fell “agonisingly short” and accused Amazon of “union-busting”.It said there were “anti-union messages by company bosses, including multiple anti-union seminars” at the warehouse.It added that “the fire lit by workers in Coventry and across the UK is still burning”, and that the union would “carry on the fight”  for low paid workers.', ""The union's fight for recognition had been described as a David vs Goliath battle, with workers facing fierce resistance from the online giant.It began with a rag tag show of defiance in the summer of 2022, after Amazon offered workers a pay rise of between 35p and 50p an hour. Having toiled in warehouses during the Covid pandemic, workers said this felt like an insult, and in Coventry a small group of angry workers spontaneously walked out and protested outside the fulfilment centre. Then the GMB got involved and urged the workforce to unionise.In January 2023, with a GMB membership of just 50, Coventry workers held the first ever Amazon strike in the UK. "", 'It went on to organise a further 37 days of industrial action over the last year and by recruiting on the picket line, steadily built up its membership to more than 1,400 members out of the centre\'s estimated 3,000 plus workers.In April the union launched a legal challenge against Amazon, claiming it used underhand tactics to encourage members to cancel their union membership.On Wednesday it said that legal challenge would continue. As part of the challenge, the GMB says Amazon put up posters in fulfilment centres featuring QR codes that generated an email to the union’s membership department requesting that their membership be cancelled.Amazon responded saying that “employees were telling us they wanted to cancel their membership but could not find a way to do so, so we provided information to help. ""We have always been clear, that union membership is an employee’s personal choice.”', 'Amazon, which is one of the UK\'s largest private sector employers, with 75,000 workers, made it clear all along that it did not want to recognise a union and that it wanted to retain direct communication with its staff. After the vote on Wednesday, it further reiterated that “having daily conversations” with staff was “an essential part of our work culture”.“We value that direct relationship and so do our employees. This is why we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, act on their feedback, and invest heavily in great pay, benefits and skills development,"" the firm added.The GMB says it is surprised by what it sees as the fearlessness of an overwhelmingly immigrant workforce, many of whom arrived recently from South Asia. Union organisers estimate that as little as 5% of the Coventry employees are British born and its campaign leaflets were translated into 12 different languages. They say that in the beginning many were frightened to get involved but as the strikes wore on, and people saw that workers who’d joined picket lines weren’t facing disciplinary action, their confidence grew.The union is hopeful that the government will strengthen their power to organise. Labour has promised legislation in today\'s King\'s Speech to make it easier for unions to win recognition ballots by lowering the required threshold for victory and to make it easier for union officials to recruit in workplaces.', 'The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said that despite taking on one of the ""world\'s largest corporate giants"", the Coventry union members ""only narrowly missed out"" on securing recognition.""With Labour set to usher in a new era of stronger workers’ rights, companies like Amazon are on the wrong side of history,"" he added.But Gregor Gall, a professor of industrial relations at Glasgow university, questioned whether GMB had the resources to take the fight to other Amazon centres.""The cost of union organising is very high. The GMB had officers working full time on it. We won\'t necessarily see organising drives elsewhere,"" he said.Professor Gall\'s caution is understandable considering what has happened in the United States. In 2022 Amazon workers at its Staten Island warehouse in New York became the first in the US to win union recognition. Two years on, the company has still not sat down to negotiate with the union and continues to fight legal challenges to the vote.']"
Musk to move SpaceX and X HQ over gender identity law,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vd097z7rvo#0,Mr Musk wants to move his two high-profile firms from California to Texas over controversial new law.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 09:35:33 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.260504,"['Billionaire Elon Musk has said he will move the headquarters of two of his most high-profile companies, rocket firm SpaceX and social media platform X, from California to Texas.He said the move was due to recent laws passed by the state - in particular a new law which prevents schools from making rules requiring staff tell anyone, including parents, information about a child\'s gender identity.A spokesperson for the governor said the law keeps ""children safe while protecting the critical role of parents"".But Mr Musk called it ""the last straw"" in a post on his social media platform. The billionaire previously moved Tesla\'s headquarters to Texas in 2021 and he is a resident of the state - which has no income tax.The issue of what schools should tell parents about their children\'s gender identities has become a major topic of debate in the US.LGBTQ advocates say students have a right to privacy, but others argue parents have a right to know what is happening with their children. ""It protects the child-parent relationship by preventing politicians and school staff from inappropriately intervening in family matters and attempting to control if, when, and how families have deeply personal conversations,"" Brandon Richards told the Associated Press. Mr Musk, who has a transgender daughter, has previously said he ""supports trans"" while expressing impatience with pronouns - calling them an ""aesthetic nightmare"".The billionaire\'s daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson filed to cut ties with him in 2022.She said she no longer wanted to ""be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form"" when applying to legally change her name and gender.', 'Last year, Mr Musk said he would lobby to criminalise transgender medical treatment.""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" he said in a post on X on Tuesday, noting that he had previously expressed his opposition to the bill.California Governor Gavin Newsom criticised Mr Musk\'s decision on social media. “You bent the knee,” he posted, along with a screenshot of a 2022 post from Donald Trump which said Mr Musk would ""drop to [his] knees and beg"" if he asked.', 'States have historically competed aggressively to woo companies to establish headquarters, bringing with them high-paying corporate jobs. SpaceX, which employs more than 5,000 people in California, according to state records, also already has a large base of operations in Texas. In response to Mr Musk\'s pledge, Greg Abbott, governor for Texas, said: ""This cements Texas as the leader in space exploration.""Neither SpaceX nor X responded to requests for comment about whether the decision to move headquarters would lead to job cuts in California. The move comes after Mr Musk formally endorsed Donald Trump for president following the assassination attempt on him on Saturday.The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Mr Musk would be directing $45m a month toward his campaign.Mr Musk responded on X with a meme implying the report was false, though he later seemed to suggest there was some truth to the claim by responding positively to a post claiming he was pledging millions of dollars to help Trump get elected.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon.']"

"", ""Decisions on pay rises for NHS staff, teachers, police and prison guards in England have to be taken by the end of this month, when the official public sector pay review process for 2024-25 must be concluded.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that the government would need to find at least an extra £7bn per year to prevent the wages of these public sector workers falling further behind their counterparts in the private sector.Data from the IFS shows that while average private sector inflation-adjusted wages are around 4% higher than in 2010, public sector wages are still around 2.5% lower.The average pay for nurses is down 6.5% over that time, teachers’ wages are 9% lower and doctors' 15% lower.Finding £7bn per year extra would be very challenging given the government’s chosen fiscal rules, which restrain its spending and taxation powers.But if it fails to do this, it could find its targets to recruit more teachers and nurses even harder to achieve - or even risk provoking further public sector strikes."", ""Local authorities in England are in a financial crisis. Five have gone into effective bankruptcy since the start of 2023, forcing deep cuts to local services.And this situation is set to worsen.A survey of local authority leaders by the Local Government Information Unit earlier this year found around 28 local authorities - about one in 10 - were likely to have to effectively declare bankruptcy this financial year (2024-25).

But that would be expensive for the Treasury.They could allow local authorities to increase council tax even further.

The body also said elections across the world had increased ""uncertainty"" over economic growth amid concerns over ""significant swings"" in policy from new governments.The IMF maintained its forecast that the world economy will grow by 3.2% in 2024, but pointed towards slightly stronger growth in 2025 at 3.3%.It also confirmed an upgrade to the UK\'s outlook for 2024 to 0.7%, but kept its forecast for 2025 unchanged. It comes ahead of fresh UK inflation figures on Wednesday, which could help to determine whether the Bank of England cuts interest rates next month.The Bank has repeatedly put up interest rates to try to control inflation, creating pain for borrowers. Rates are currently at a 16-year high of 5.25%.UK inflation - which measures the pace of price rises - has fallen sharply since last year to 2%, in line with the Bank of England\'s official target. However, price rises in the important services sector remain high.IMF chief economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas said the UK was “in some ways similar” to the US in terms of sticky inflation.In its latest outlook update, the IMF said: ""The momentum on global disinflation is slowing, signalling bumps along the path.""The risk of elevated inflation has raised the prospects of higher-for-even-longer interest rates, which in turn increases external, fiscal, and financial risks.""However, on markets for UK government debt, the effective interest rate on a two-year gilt fell below 4% for the first time this year. This suggests increasing optimism that rates will be coming down soon.This is likely to continue the brewing mortgage price war, with fixed rates coming down even before the Bank makes its next rates decision on 1 August. ', 'While the IMF raised its global growth outlook for next year slightly, its forecast for  US growth in 2024 was downgraded to 2.6%, below the 2.7% forecast in April, due to a ""slower-than-expected start to the year"".The IMF said political uncertainty linked to elections around the world could affect its projections.It said it was “too early” to assess the economic policies of the new Labour government, but noted that some of Sir Kier Starmer\'s plans were in keeping with the IMF’s detailed advice in its annual review of the British economy.Separately it said that the “direction of travel” on US borrowing was of concern, as America\'s national debt continues to rise.Higher public borrowing tends to drive up government borrowing costs which can have a knock-on effect on mortgage rates and other consumer loans.     ""The potential for significant swings in economic policy as a result of elections this year, with negative spill-overs to the rest of the world, has increased the uncertainty around the baseline,"" the IMF said.It added that a rise in trade barriers such as export restrictions and tariffs also posed a risk to the global economy. More than 3,000 such measures were brought in last year, up from an already-high level of 1,000 in 2019.The IMF said these policies could trigger retaliation and a ""costly race to the bottom"".""We see an explosion in the number of trade restrictive measures,"" said Mr Gourinchas.""One concern we have is that going forward, this will weigh down on global activity.""']"

He is still employed by the company.He left school at 16, studied electronics at college and worked as a builder before joining ICL, which later became Fujitsu.His initial role on the Horizon team was supervising the machine which produced cryptographic keys to secure Horizon machines.But his duties soon expanded to providing witness statements in cases accusing sub-postmasters of theft and false accounting. This involved extracting audit record query data – detailing what keys had been pressed within Post Office branches – and records of calls to the Horizon helpdesk.One of his colleagues, who was more directly involved with the helpdesk queries, was not willing to give evidence as, according to Mr Dunks, she found the process ""a bit daunting"".And in Mr Dunks’ witness statement, he said that after the case of Mr Castleton case in 2006, the manager of the Software Support Centre (SSC) team Mik Peach “did not want any of his team to go to court"".Mr Peach sent an email after the trial saying ""the SSC [Software Support Centre, which operated the helpdesk] is NOT in position to undertake this role"".But Mr Dunks did provide witness statements, compiling them from pre-drafted paragraphs identified by capital letters, assembled following instructions from the Post Office. He was not able to tell the inquiry who originally drafted them.These covered the operation of the Horizon IT helpdesk, which he admitted having little knowledge of.In Mrs Misra’s case and others, he told courts that the numerous calls put in by sub-postmasters were not a sign that the counters were not working properly.Mrs Misra was eight weeks pregnant with her second child when she was sentenced to 15 months in prison in 2010.When giving opinions about helpdesk matters, Mr Dunks said he informed himself by conversations with SSC staff, often face-to-face, but that these conversations were not recorded by him.He was asked by barrister Flora Page if he was covering for the SSC ""because they were not prepared to stand up and defend Horizon in court"".“No, that’s not how it worked,” he replied.', 'During the hearing Mr Dunks was presented with emails which appeared to show the Fujitsu team taking a light-hearted approach to the prosecutions.In 2006, before he gave evidence in the Mr Castleton\'s case, his boss Peter Sewell wrote: ""That Castleton is a nasty chap and will be all out to rubbish the Fujitsu name. It’s up to you to maintain absolute strength and integrity no matter what the prosecution throw at you.""""Thank you for those very kind and encouraging words,"" replied Mr Dunks. ""I had to pause half way through reading it to wipe away a small tear.""Former sub-postmaster Mr Castleton was made bankrupt by the Post Office after a two year legal battle.At the inquiry, Mr Dunks denied that he was being sarcastic or joking, and said his manager was just trying to put him at ease.In 2002, the year he joined the security team, Mr Dunks was copied into an email from a Fujitsu staffer, Martin Riddell, congratulating the team on providing a witness statement to help to secure a conviction.""If I was a caring sharing manager I would buy a drink for everyone involved. But I\'m not. So I won’t,"" Mr Riddell wrote.']"
All water firms now investigated for sewage spills,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg5ev7e46mo#1,All 11 companies in England and Wales are now being probed after the regulator expands its investigation.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 14:36:39 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.261506,"['All 11 water and wastewater companies in England and Wales are now under scrutiny over sewage spills, after the regulator said it was expanding its investigation.On Tuesday, Ofwat opened enforcement cases into four more firms - Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy, Severn Trent and United Utilities - as part of its probe into how companies manage their sewage treatment works and networks.It began its investigation in 2021 and if found in breach the companies face being fined.Ofwat chief executive David Black said the latest move showed ""how concerned we are about the sector\'s environmental performance"".It comes a week after water firms hit back at Ofwat\'s proposal of a £19-a-year rise in bills to tackle problems including sewage leaks, with the companies saying the increase would not be enough.Water suppliers have faced increased scrutiny over their environmental and financial performance, as well as executive bonuses and pay.In May, the BBC found that millions of litres of raw sewage were illegally pumped into one of England\'s most famous lakes, Windermere in the Lake District, after a fault, and that United Utilities failed to stop what was found to be illegal pollution.Every major English water company has reported data suggesting they have discharged raw sewage when the weather is dry - a practice which is potentially illegal.Water companies can release untreated sewage into rivers and seas when it rains to prevent it flooding homes, but such spills are illegal when it is dry.Announcing the four firms facing new enforcement action, Ofwat said its investigation had highlighted its ""concerns that these companies may not be fulfilling their obligations to protect the environment and minimise pollution"".The regulator already has enforcement cases against Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, South West Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water.Southern Water also remains subject to enforcement monitoring following a previous case in 2019, Ofwat said. It was fined £90m in 2021 after pleading guilty to 6,971 ""unpermitted sewage discharges"".', '""Where we find that companies have breached their obligations, we will continue to act - over recent years, we have imposed penalties and payments of over £300m on water and wastewater companies,"" said Mr Black.United Utilities said in a statement: ""We understand and share people\'s concerns about the health of the environment and the operation of wastewater systems"".A spokesperson for Hafren Dyfrdwy said the firm would ""ensure that we will not be the reason for any unhealthy rivers in Wales by 2030"" and would be ""rapidly reducing"" polluting spills.Severn Trent said it recently announced a programme worth £1bn to reduce its impact on rivers to ""almost zero by 2030"".Dŵr Cymru said it  ""will not shy away from the challenges facing us"".Last year, the Environment Agency said in its annual review that the number of serious pollution incidents was ""unacceptably high"", and that water companies needed to go ""further and faster"".']"

"Royal Mail will deliver letters forever, vows buyer",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngjx9nn92o#1,Daniel Kretinsky says he will not walk away from the Universal Service Obligation to deliver letters.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 09:49:07 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.262229,"['The prospective new owner of Royal Mail has said he will not walk away from the requirement to deliver letters throughout the UK six days a week, as long as he is running the service.""As long as I\'m alive, I completely exclude this,"" Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky told the BBC.Mr Kretinsky has had a £3.6bn offer for Royal Mail accepted by its board.Shareholders are expected to approve the deal in the coming months, but the government also has a say over whether it goes ahead.', 'Currently the Universal Service Obligation (USO) requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week throughout the country for the same price. But questions have been raised over whether the service could be reduced in the future.In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Kretinsky also said he would be willing to share profits with employees, if given the go-ahead to buy the group.However, he appeared to reject the idea of employees having a stake in Royal Mail, which unions have called for in exchange for their support.The Royal Mail board agreed a £3.6bn takeover offer from Mr Kretinsky in May for the 500-year-old organisation, which employs more than 150,000 people. Including assumed debts, the offer is worth £5bn.But because Royal Mail is a nationally important company, the government has the power to scrutinise and potentially block the deal.', 'As well as keeping the new government on side, Mr Kretinsky also faces the task of convincing postal unions that the proposed deal will benefit employees.The USO is a potential sticking point for both the government and unions.Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK for a fixed price.How well this has actually been working in practice is a different matter. Ten years ago, 92% of first class post arrived on time. By the end of last year it was down to 74%, according to the regulator Ofcom.Last year the regulator fined Royal Mail £5.6m for failing to meet its delivery targets.Royal Mail has been pushing for this obligation to be watered down. It wants to cut second class letter deliveries to every other weekday, saying this will save £300m, and lead to ""fewer than 1,000"" voluntary redundancies.', 'Mr Kretinsky has committed in writing to honouring the USO, but only for five years.And after that, in theory, the new owners could just walk away from it.However, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC: ""As long as I\'m alive, I completely exclude this, and I\'m sure that anybody that would be my successor would absolutely understand this.""I say this as an absolutely clear, unconditional commitment: Royal Mail is going to be the provider of Universal Service Obligation in the UK, I would say forever, as long as the service is going to be needed, and as long as we are going to be around.""Mr Kretinsky added that the written five-year commitment was ""the longest commitment that has ever been offered in a situation like this"".', 'Another potential stumbling block for the deal, however, is how the company will be structured.Unions would like to see the company renationalised, but Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), told the BBC that would be ""difficult in the current political and economic environment"".Instead, what the CWU is pushing for is ""a different model of ownership"" - that is, where the employees part-own the business.To get its support for the takeover, the union wants employees to share ownership of the company, along with other concessions including board representation for workers.It says profit sharing is ""not going to be enough to deliver our support and the support of the workforce"".', 'If the union doesn\'t get what it wants, it won\'t rule out industrial action, Mr Ward said. Its members went on strike in 2022 and 2023.Although Mr Kretinsky said he is ""very open"" to profit sharing, he is not in favour of shared ownership.""I don\'t think the ownership stake is the right model,"" he said. ""The logic is: share of profit, yes, [but an] ownership structure creates a lot of complexity.""For instance, what happens if the employee leaves? He has shares, he is leaving, he is not working for the company, he [still] needs remunerating.""Mr Kretinsky said he didn\'t want to create ""some anonymous structure"" but instead ""remunerate the people who are working for the company, and creating value for the company"".The union is also concerned about job losses and changes to the terms and conditions of postal workers\' contracts.Mr Kretinsky has guaranteed no compulsory redundancies or changes in terms and conditions but only until 2025.""If we are more successful, and we have more parcels to be delivered, we need not less people, but we need more people,"" he said. ""So really, job cuts are not part of our plan at all.""', 'He said if the management, union and employees work together, ""we will be successful"".Another concern is the potential break-up of the business.The profit for Royal Mail\'s parent company last year was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, GLS. Royal Mail itself made a loss. Mr Kretinsky has promised not to split off GLS or load the parent company with excessive debt, although borrowings will rise if the deal goes through.But he has a way to go to convince the CWU.""I can\'t think of any other country in the world that would just just hand over its entire postal service to an overseas equity investor,"" Mr Ward of the CWU said.However, Mr Kretinsky said that the postal unions ""do understand that we are on the same ship, and that we need this ship to be successful, and that if we are there,  we don\'t have any real problems to deal with, because the sky is blue, and it\'s blue for everybody.""The union cannot stop this deal but the government can block it under the National Security and Investment Act. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said he will scrutinise the assurances and guarantees given and called on Mr Kretinsky to work constructively with the unions.Mr Kretinsky may say that he and the unions are ultimately on the same ship but, as things stand, they are not on the same page.', ""Daniel Kretinsky started his career as a lawyer in his hometown of Brno, before moving to Prague.He then made serious money in Central and Eastern European energy interests.This includes Eustream, which transports Russian gas via pipelines that run through Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.He then diversified into other investments, including an almost 10% stake in UK supermarket chain Sainsbury's and a 27% share in Premier League club West Ham United.The Czech businessman is worth about £6bn, according to reports.""]"

North Sea operators warned to step up decommissioning,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxr20270x50o#1,The North Sea Transition Authority says operators must leave the marine environment clean and safe when they stop producing.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 05:28:13 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.262897,"['Oil and gas operators have been warned by regulators to step up decommissioning in the North Sea.The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) wants companies to clean up their oil and gas legacy and said it was ""getting tough"" on operators not meeting their regulatory obligations.Repeated delays to well plugging and abandonment - where wells are plugged with concrete to protect groundwater resources and prevent surface pollution and methane emission - were pushing up the estimated bill for decommissioning on the UK Continental Shelf, the NSTA said.The facts have been laid out in the NSTA\'s latest decommissioning cost and performance update.It comes after Pauline Innes, the NSTA’s supply chain and decommissioning director, warned licensees last November to make headway on the plugging and abandonment of wells. She warned that those failing to comply would be held to account.', 'Now the regulator has begun investigations into alleged failures to complete timely plugging and abandonment in line with approved plans.Operators are legally required to leave the marine environment clean and safe when they stop producing, and must decommission their platforms, pipelines and wells - a complex and expensive process which requires thorough preparation and planning.Taking too long, or deferring work, adds to the cost and can mean that platforms continue to use power and release emissions even though they are no longer producing oil and gas.The removal of spent structures from the North Sea is expensive for the oil and gas industry, but was seen as an opportunity for a growing sector.Operators expect to spend about £24bn on decommissioning between 2023 and 2032, up £3bn on the forecast for the same period in last year’s report. Hundreds of wells will need to be decommissioned every year as more oil and gas fields shut down. However, operators only achieved 70% of planned well decommissioning activities last year.', 'The NSTA said some operators were deferring in the hope that prices would fall, but failing to award contracts reduces the supply chain’s revenues and ability to invest in capacity and resources. Ms Innes said: ""With spending forecast to peak at £2.5bn per year in the current decade, decommissioning can ensure that the UK’s world-leading supply chain is equipped to help operators clean up their oil and gas infrastructure over the next 50 years and support the carbon storage sector, which will rely on many of the same resources.""I am concerned that this huge opportunity to safeguard highly-skilled jobs and support the transition will be wasted if operators fail to tackle their well decommissioning backlogs.""She added: ""The supply chain wants to do this work, but it is not physically tied to the UK.""Its skills and resources are in demand in other regions, and we are starting to see companies marketing their rigs elsewhere. ""Operators need to use the supply chain, now, or risk losing it.""Offshore Energies UK said it was a ""complex multi-billion-pound process"" which involved detailed technical preparation and planning.Ricky Thomson, the trade body\'s decommissioning manager, said: ""Efficient decommissioning continues to be an industry priority.""We need a collaborative effort to achieve safe, efficient and effective decommissioning.""Around 12,000 offshore oil and gas platforms worldwide which are nearing the end of their operational lives need to be decommissioned and the UK will continue to be a global leader at the forefront of this effort.""']"

Kaspersky, which had been operating in the US for two decades, has denied the allegations.""Starting from July 20, 2024 Kaspersky will gradually wind down its US operations and eliminate US-based positions,"" the firm said in a statement. Its US website has already stopped selling its antivirus and cybersecurity tools, with a message reading ""purchase is unavailable for US customers"".The announcement came after sales and distribution of Kaspersky products were banned in the US.Ms Raimondo said the US was compelled to take action due to Russia\'s ""capacity and... intent to collect and weaponise the personal information of Americans"".""Kaspersky will generally no longer be able to, among other activities, sell its software within the United States or provide updates to software already in use,"" the Commerce Department said.The ruling used broad powers created by the Trump administration to ban or restrict transactions between US firms and technology companies from ""foreign adversary"" nations like Russia and China.It effectively barred downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the products from 29 September, while new business was to be restricted within 30 days of the announcement.Sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department.According to the Commerce Department, the Moscow-headquartered multinational company has offices in 31 countries around the world, servicing more than 400 million users and 270,000 corporate clients in more than 200 countries.At the time Kaspersky said it intended to pursue ""all legally available options"" to fight the ban, and denied it engaged in any activity that threatened US security.']"

Shares of its predecessor company started rallying in January, after Mr Trump defeated Republican challengers in the primaries. The price soared further after Trump Media formally debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange in March. But shares slumped at the start of his criminal trial in April, in which he was later convicted of fraud charges linked to hush-money that was paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels.The current share price remains below levels seen in March.

""China’s economy hit the brakes in the June quarter,"" said Heron Lim at Moody\'s Analytics, adding that analysts are hoping for solutions from the meeting under way in Beijing, also called the Third Plenum. The world\'s second-largest economy is facing a prolonged property crisis, steep local government debt, weak consumption and high unemployment.Past outcomes of the Plenum have changed the course of history in China - in 1978, then leader Deng Xiaoping began opening China\'s markets to the world, and in 2013 President Xi Jinping hinted at loosening the controversial one-child policy.  And so there are expectations of this year\'s Plenum, where  Mr Xi is presiding over a closed-door gathering of 370-plus high-ranking Chinese Communist Party members. The rhetoric on state-controlled media has certainly been encouraging.  An editorial in The Global Times said a ""wide range of reform-focused polices"" are ""high on the agenda"" and would usher in a ""new chapter"". Xinhua referred to ""comprehensive"" and ""unprecedented"" reforms. The editorial in the People\'s Daily was headlined on a ""new era of reform and opening up"", invoking the very phrase Deng coined in 1978. Observers, however, are unsure of how much room there is for bold ideas or debate in the Party under Mr Xi\'s heavily-centralised leadership. Some see the meeting as a mere rubber-stamping exercise for decisions that have already been made.Economists are also sceptical the meeting will deliver a quick fix. It has ""little impact on near-term growth,"" says Qian Wang, Asia Pacific chief economist at Vanguard, because its focus will be on longer-term and more significant reforms to ""unleash the long-term growth potential"". Still, analysts will be watching for announcements that signal the Party\'s economic priorities. ', 'Separate data on Monday showed that prices for new homes in June fell at the fastest pace in nine years.  This is more evidence of the crisis that has engulfed China\'s property sector and led to the demise of giants such as Evergrande. The fear is that it could spread to other parts of the economy.""There are more than 4,000 banks in China and over 90% are smaller, regional banks which are highly exposed to the housing market and local government debt,"" says Shanghai-based economist Dan Wang.She believes Party leaders will  ""push for consolidation of small banks"". Another issue is falling prices - a symptom of weak demand.Producer prices continued to drop in the last month, while consumer prices rose by a mere 0.2%, the slowest pace in three months.Meanwhile, retail sales in June grew by just 2%, which is below expectations and a sign that consumers are still cautious about spending and uncertain of the future.  ""A major concern is the loss of household, business, and investor confidence in the government’s ability to navigate the perilous economic environment,"" said Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund\'s China division.Still, questions remain about Beijing\'s willingness to deliver the sort of solution that would satisfy observers and the markets. ""The government is reluctant to turn to short-term stimulus plans such as cash transfer to families,"" Dan Wang said. ""Instead, we expect them to stress once again on bolstering supply chains and high tech."" That is in line with Beijing\'s bets on high-tech industries such as renewable energy, artificial intelligence and chip-making, and exports to revive the economy. Last month, China reported a record trade surplus - $99bn (£76.4bn) - as exports soared and imports struggled. But even that bet faces challenging odds. Major trading partners such as the European Union and the United States have imposed tariffs and other barriers on goods made in China, from electric vehicles to advanced chips.']"
She's made her opening gambit. What's the chancellor's long game?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjw6l53xe2o#1,"Once a junior chess champion, now Rachel Reeves runs the UK economy. Faisal Islam looks at her strategy.","Sun, 14 Jul 2024 02:44:57 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.263950,"['Rachel Reeves\' favourite chess move is the Sicilian Defence.It\'s an opening move designed to open up the board for later in the game - and one the chancellor used often as a junior chess champion. It\'s “particularly good when you want to go on the attack,"" she suggests.Growing up, Reeves was driven around the country by her parents to compete and beat privately educated boys, often as the only state school-educated girl. The story has echoes of the fictitious chess prodigy Beth Harmon - the lead character in Netflix show The Queen’s Gambit, of which Reeves is a fan - playing out entire imaginary chess games on her bedroom ceiling, several moves ahead.At No 11, Reeves is now applying the mathematics of constantly changing trade-offs to running the country’s economy.', 'As she told me at her general election count, four hours after the exit poll had dropped, “there’s not a huge amount of money there” and therefore she was “willing to have a fight” on ripping up red tape holding back the private sector from building new homes and rebuilding Britain’s infrastructure.In the 72 hours that followed, Treasury officials worked through the weekend to put together Labour’s planning shake-up as part of a big bang announcement to communicate directly to business leaders.It was designed to show total commitment to the growth agenda. Two green-belt data centres that had been blocked by local councils were given planning permission. Two house-building projects were unlocked, too.In her first speech as chancellor, Reeves was stressing to investors that Labour was willing to use its landslide election majority to take politically controversial steps that would not have been possible under even a stable version of the previous government. The presence of so many members of the cabinet at the speech was meant to signal an end to the years of soap opera, psychodrama and unstable personality politics.Reeves wants the Treasury to be about more than tax and spend. It will be the “growth department” too, with the peer Spencer Livermore, now effectively her deputy for growth, alongside the Chief Secretary Darren Jones, who will focus on tax.With her first announcements, she wants to convey an optimistic path for the UK that is attractive to investors. ', ""Those in the room for her first speech as chancellor seemed enthused enough. In private, top business people have told me that stability of strategy, policy and the ministers in charge would indeed represent a huge change. But the proof will be in the new investments, the spades in the ground, and eventually the number of wind turbines and new houses.The hope is to not just accept the difficult situation on borrowing, tax and spend, but to “improve the trade-offs”, the chancellor says, again showing her chess thinking.The more confident investors are in Labour’s plans, the more money will pour in, and the more tangible improvements in the economy will be. The  government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has previously given credit to policies that it expects to boost the economy, for example factoring in former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s childcare policy into its growth forecasts. If it does the same for Reeves' planning policies, there might be less pressure for spending cuts and tax rises.In next week’s King’s Speech there will be new legislation enhancing the independence and role of the OBR, which Liz Truss infamously and disastrously sidelined at her mini-Budget.Later in the month, the chancellor will publish some details on the state of the public finances. This could help set early parameters for big tax and spending numbers in the autumn.  "", 'She has already said she will be tough on adhering to rules designed to limit borrowing for day-to-day spending. Currently, Reeves would need to make some very tough choices, potentially cutting spending on councils, prisons and courts and raising some taxes to do this.This will come to a head in an autumn Budget and Spending Review.When pushed on whether she can really deliver a step-change to housebuilding, infrastructure and energy investment, while her government continues cuts to public investment planned by the Conservatives, Reeves is defiant.“We need the private sector to build homes, we are not going to be in the business of constructing homes ourselves,” she replied,The more the private sector steps up, the better these difficult trade-offs will get - with more money from outside, the less the government will have to make difficult decisions on spending cuts or tax rises.Conversely, if the private sector is expected to do not just the heavy lifting but all the lifting on investment to power growth, it gives it strong leverage over policy.For example, Labour says it will deliver 1.5 million new homes over this parliament, but what will it do if housebuilders ask which construction workers will build such homes? How will it answer the energy firms saying that regulator Ofgem needs to free up regional pricing of electricity so that Scotland can benefit with cheap or even free energy arising from its surplus wind power? The question is: what is Reeves prepared to sacrifice in order to meet Labour’s “number one” growth mission?', ""Looming large over Reeves' decisions is a desire not to create an overbearing strategy that leverages its power over the purse strings to dictate policy, as occurred on occasion in Gordon Brown’s Treasury.The chancellor’s colleagues say now the “weight of opposition” has been lifted from her shoulders, she can now focus on changing policy.Rachel Reeves’ team says her chess-like strategy is to fix foundations first, then to rebuild Britain, and then to make every part of the UK better off. Her first moves this week show that she and her government are playing a rather long game.Top picture: Getty Images"", 'BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

How AI is fuelling uncertainty for game developers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl44mv0jnv5o#2,In a struggling games industry AI has been hailed as a possible saviour. But not everyone's convinced.,"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 23:05:46 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264066,"['""I\'m very aware that I could wake up tomorrow and my job could be gone,” says Jess Hyland.The video game artist says the industry she’s spent almost 15 years working in is on “shaky” ground at the moment.A boom in players and profits during the pandemic sparked a flurry of investments, expansions and acquisitions that, in hindsight, now look short-sighted.Gaming remains profitable, but thousands of workers worldwide have lost their jobs, and successful studios have been shut down over the past two years.More closures and cuts are feared.""Everyone knows someone who\'s been laid off. There\'s lots of worry about the future,"" says Jess.Some bosses are talking up the potential of generative AI - the tech behind tools such as ChatGPT - as a potential saviour.Tech giant Nvidia has shown off impressive development tool prototypes, and gaming industry heavyweights such as Electronic Arts and Ubisoft are investing in the tech.It\'s claimed AI tools can save development time, free workers up to focus on creativity and provide a more personalised user experience.With budgets at the blockbuster end of the industry spiralling as audience expectations rise with them, it sounds like a perfect solution.But not to everyone.', '""The people who are most excited about AI enabling creativity aren\'t creatives,"" says Jess, a member of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain\'s game workers branch. She sits on its artificial intelligence working group. Against the backdrop of widespread layoffs, Jess says the suspicion among workers is that bosses see AI as a path to cutting costs when labour is their biggest expense.Jess says she knows one person who\'s lost work due to AI, and has heard of it happening to others.There are also dozens of accounts online suggesting that jobs in concept art and other traditionally entry-level roles have been affected.Most firms making AI tools insist they\'re not designed to replace humans, and there\'s broad agreement that the technology is a long way from being able to do so.Jess says the bigger worry is that ""jobs are going to change, but not in a good way"".Rather than creating their own material, says Jess, artists worry they could end up supplementing AI\'s efforts, rather than the other way around.', 'Publicly available AI image generators, for example, can quickly output impressive-looking results from simple text prompts, but are famously poor at rendering hands. They can also struggle with chairs.""The stuff that AI generates, you become the person whose job is fixing it,"" says Jess. ""It\'s not why I got into making games."" Gaming is a multibillion-dollar business but it\'s also an artistic medium that brings together artists, musicians, writers, programmers and actors, to name just some.A frequent concern is that AI will serve to minimise, rather than enable, the work of those creatives.', 'It\'s a view echoed by Chris Knowles, a former senior engine developer at UK gaming firm Jagex, known for its Runescape title.""If you\'re going to have to hire actual human artists to fix the output, why not harness their creativity and make something new that connects with players?"" he says.Chris, who now runs UK indie studio Sidequest Ninja, says that in his experience smaller developers are generally unenthusiastic about using generative AI.One of his concerns is around cloned games.Online game stores - where indie developers make most of their sales - are rife with imitations of original titles. This is especially true of mobile games, says Chris, and there are studios set up ""entirely to churn out clones"".It\'s not yet possible to rip off a whole game using AI, he says, but copying assets such as artwork is easily done.""Anything that makes the clone studios\' business model even cheaper and quicker makes the difficult task of running a financially sustainable indie studio even harder,"" says Chris. He also points to the huge amounts of electricity required to run generative AI systems as a big concern. ', 'Copyright concerns over generative AI - currently the subject of several ongoing legal cases - are one of the biggest barriers to its wider use in gaming right now.Tools are trained on vast quantities of text and pictures scraped from the internet and, like many artists, Jess believes it amounts to ""mass copyright infringement"".Some studios are exploring systems trained on internal data, and third parties advertising ethical tools that claim to work off authorised sources are springing up.Even then, the fear is that AI will be used to turn out assets such as artwork and 3D models at scale, and the expectation on workers will be to produce more output.""The more content you can make, the more money you can make,"" says Jess.', 'Some in the industry are more positive about AI.Composer Borislav Slavov, who won a Bafta Games Award for his work on Baldur\'s Gate 3, told the BBC he was ""excited about what AI could bring to the table for music in the near future"".Speaking at the recent Games Music Festival in London, he said he believed it would enable composers to ""explore music directions faster"" and push them out of their comfort zones.""This would allow the composers to focus way more on the essence - getting inspired and composing deeply emotional and strong themes,"" he said.However, he did agree that AI could not ""replace the human soul and spirit"".While she has serious personal reservations about using the tech to ""automate creativity"", Jess says she wouldn\'t be against using it to bear the burden of some of the more repetitive admin tasks that are a feature of most projects.', 'The AI industry is currently trying to reassure governments and regulators over concerns about its future use, as shown by a recent law passed by the EUIt will also have to work hard to win over another group - gamers.Online shooter The Finals received a backlash over its use of synthesised voice lines, and developer Square Enix was criticised for the limited use of generated art in its multiplayer game Foamstars.Jess believes growing talk about AI has made gamers ""think about what they love about games and what\'s special about that - sharing experiences crafted by other humans"".""I\'m still putting something of myself into it and I think there\'s a growing recognition of that.""Indie developer Chris adds: ""If you train a generative model on nothing but cave paintings, all it\'ll ever give you will be cave paintings. ""It takes humans to get from there to the Sistine Chapel.""Additional reporting by Laura Cress.']"
Is Brazil's Brics-building worth it?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0venrydg8yo#2,The Brazilian president sees the Brics as a way to remake the world - but it is dominated by China.,"Sun, 14 Jul 2024 23:09:43 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264177,"['It\'s been more than a year-and-a-half since Brazil\'s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva returned to the country\'s presidency, back from the political dead after his conviction on corruption charges was dramatically annulled.In that time, President Lula\'s comeback has given renewed force to one of the world\'s most unlikely economic alliances - the Brics, a grouping that unites Brazil with Russia, India, China and South Africa.In his previous time as president from 2003 to 2010, Lula was instrumental in efforts to weld the Brics into a geopolitical entity, and an emerging counterweight to the West.Now the bloc has momentum on its side once again. It\'s come to be known as Brics Plus, after the original members agreed at a watershed summit in Johannesburg in August last year to admit a handful of new joiners, including Saudi Arabia and Iran.Not bad for a grouping that was originally willed into being by sheer high-concept financial whimsy, the brainchild of economist Jim O\'Neill, who saw it more as an  investment opportunity than a new gang of nations.""When the Brics were invented, it was pretty much an asset class,"" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.""But it caught on in Brazil, because it directly spoke to Lula\'s aspirations in foreign policy.""', 'At the Johannesburg meeting, Lula was particularly bullish about the group\'s long-term economic prospects.“We have already surpassed the G7 and account for 32% of global GDP in purchasing power parity,"" he said. ""Projections indicate that emerging and developing markets will be those that will show the highest growth rate in the coming years,"" he went on. ""This shows that the dynamism of the economy is in the global south and the Brics is its driving force.”', 'But that is disingenuous on Lula\'s part, to say the least. As has been pointed out by the originator of the Bric acronym, who now rejoices in the title of Baron O\'Neill of Gatley, all the economic growth in the group has actually come from Xi Jinping\'s China and Narendra Modi\'s India.""None of the other Brics has performed anywhere near as well as those two,"" he said in an article written in reaction to the bloc\'s expansion.""Brazil and Russia account for around the same share of global GDP as they did in 2001, and South Africa is not even the largest economy in Africa [Nigeria has surpassed it]."" As he also points out, China ""dominates the Brics by being twice the size of all the others combined"", in much the same way that the US dominates the G7.', 'So what does slow-growth Brazil gain from being dragged along in China\'s economic slipstream? Rodrigo Zeidan, a Brazilian economist based at China\'s New York University Shanghai, tells the BBC that Brazil and China alike see the Brics as a ""hedge"" in terms of global alliances, rather than as a top priority.""The Brics right now, for Brazil, cost almost nothing,"" he says. ""So if the benefits are not high, it\'s fine. They are neither a big benefit nor a hindrance.""Since China is its biggest trading partner, Brazil is comfortable maintaining close relations with Beijing, even if the Brics grouping provides it with some ""strange bedfellows"", as Mr Zeidan puts it.Lula has certainly maintained an ambiguous position on Russia\'s war in Ukraine, but that is more due to Brazil\'s traditional neutrality in foreign policy than to a wish to support a fellow Brics nation.For Monica de Bolle at the Peterson Institute, herself a Brazilian economist, President Lula showed ""a lot of naivety"" in committing to the Brics because of his belief in furthering relations among the big so-called global south nations.As a result, Brazil has now acquired ""a China dependency"" that could harm it in other foreign policy relations, she says.""If you are in the US, you know that the US stance on China is not going to change [whoever wins the presidential election in November],"" she adds.""In either case, it\'s moving in the direction of greater anti-China sentiment. At some point, that\'s going to create additional reactions from China, which could put Brazil in a very difficult position, because it\'s perceived as being aligned with China.""', 'One tangible gain for Brazil from the alliance comes in the shape of the New Development Bank (NDB), a multilateral lender founded by the Brics and described by Lula as ""a milestone in effective collaboration between emerging economies"".It is currently headed by Brazilian ex-President Dilma Rousseff. She was President Lula\'s political protegee, and succeeded him in 2011. But her time in office came to a chaotic end when she was impeached in 2016 for breaking budgetary laws.The NDB has not only returned her to public life, but since the bank\'s headquarters are in Shanghai, it makes her key to maintaining links between Brazil and China.""Dilma is definitely huge in terms of political image. Having Dilma here in Shanghai is very important for strengthening Brazil-China relations,"" says Mr Zeidan.Brazil has also benefited directly from NDB money. In June, Ms Rousseff and Brazilian Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin signed a loan deal worth more than $1.1bn (£880m) to help pay for reconstruction after widespread floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.Regarding the NDB and Russia, the bank put all transactions involving the country on hold in March 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And the NDB has complied with international sanctions against Russia.But Russia is due to take over the rotating presidency of the bank in mid-2025 and there is some uncertainty over what will happen then.In the meantime, Ms Rousseff is not averse to attending financial gatherings in Russia, and shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has praised her work at the helm of the NDB.', 'President Lula is a passionate advocate of the Brics as a means of reforming global governance and giving a greater voice to the developing world. He has criticised the ""paralysis"" of global institutions, while praising the expansion of the Brics as strengthening the fight for more diverse perspectives.But other observers retort that the Brics are themselves paralysed by their own internal contradictions, with Russia at war in Ukraine, while China and India have their own mutual squabbles.Ultimately, says Ms de Bolle in Washington, the Brics are ""a heterogeneous group of countries that have nothing in common, apart from the fact that they are big"".""The Brics have no clear agenda that has any real weight,"" agrees Mr Zeidan in Shanghai. ""Right now, China doesn\'t ask much of Brazil. However, anything that China asks, Brazil does.""It\'s fine to be part of the Brics when the stakes are low. But what if the stakes rise?""In other words, the effect of the Brics, on Brazil and on the world, may be minor for now. But if China decides to become more assertive, that could change rapidly - and Brazil could be faced with some uncomfortable choices.']"

But now everyone pays with UPI. Scan the code and the payment is done within seconds.""No issues of handling cash, giving change to customers. It has made my life and business smooth,” he says.', ""UPI, or to give it its full name the Unified Payments Interface, was launched in 2016  in a collaboration between India's central bank and the nation's banking industry.It's an app-based instant payment system, which allows users to send and receive money, pay bills and authorise payments in a single step - no need to enter bank details or any other personal information. And, perhaps most importantly, it's free.It has become so popular that India is now the biggest real-time payments market.In May, UPI recorded 14 billion transactions, up from nine billion the year before. "", 'But the popularity and ease of use has made it a rich feeding ground for scammers.“While digital payments are convenient, they do come with vulnerabilities,"" says Shashank Shekhar, founder of the Delhi-based Future Crime Research Foundation.Mr Shekhar says that scammers use a variety of ways to trick people, including persuading them to share their UPI pin number, which is needed to authorise payments.Some scammers have also created fake UPI apps, that are clones of legitimate banking apps, and then steal login details or other valuable information.""The pace at which digital transformation took place in the country means unfortunately digital literacy and safe internet practice could not catch up,"" says Mr Shekhar.He says that between January 2020 and June 2023 almost half of all financial fraud involved the use of the UPI system.According to government figures there were more than 95,000 cases of fraud involving UPI in the financial year ending April 2023, up from 77,000 in the previous year.', 'Shivkali was one such victim. She had always wanted to own a scooter, but they were beyond her budget.However, earlier in the year the 22-year-old, who lives in Bihar state in northeastern India, spotted one for sale on Facebook that looked like a great deal.""I grabbed the opportunity without thinking,"" she says. A couple of clicks later and she was talking to the owner, who said that for $23 he would send over the vehicle papers.That went smoothly, so Shivkali continued to send the owner money, via instant transfers. She eventually ended up paying $200, but the scooter (also commonly called a Scooty in India), was never delivered.Shivkali realised she had been scammed.""I did not think I could be cheated, as I have some education background and know what is happing in the world. But scammers are smart. They have an art of speaking to convince the opposite person,” she says.The government and the central bank are looking at ways to protect UPI users from scammers.But at the moment, if a victim wants compensation, they have to approach their bank.“The problem is deep rooted,"" says Dr Durgesh Pandey, an expert in financial crime.""Most of the onus lies with banks and telecom companies. They are lax in making identity checks, that’s why the fraudster can’t be traced.""But the challenge for banks particularly is that they have to balance between inclusivity, ease of business and enforcement of identity checks. If they are too rigid, the vulnerable section of society will remain without banking facilities.”But Dr Pandey argues that in most cases of fraud, the bank is not totally to blame.“It’s a complex question because the problem lies with banks, but it’s the victim who is giving his credentials in most case. I would say both victim and bank should bear the loss.”', 'Despite those problems, UPI is being promoted in rural areas where access to banking services can be difficult.Poonam Untwal from Rajasthan runs a guidance centre which helps people use the internet and digital banking.""Most of us are not that educated, nor know the proper use of smartphones.

Now we can receive and send money with UPI. People who don’t have smart phones come to my centre to get their transactions done,"" she says.As well as making inroads into rural areas, UPI is spreading overseas.Retailers in Bhutan, Mauritius, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and UAE will take UPI payments.

Will K-pop's AI experiment pay off?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngr3r0914o#2,"Some of the genre's biggest names are now using artificial intelligence, but fans are divided.","Tue, 16 Jul 2024 08:31:00 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264531,"['There’s an issue dividing K-pop fans right now - artificial intelligence.Several of the genre’s biggest stars have now experimented with the technology to create music videos and produce songs, including boy band Seventeen.Last year the South Korean group sold around 16 million albums, making them one of the most successful K-pop acts in history. But it’s their most recent album and single, Maestro, that’s got people talking.The music video features an AI-generated scene, and at the launch of the album in Seoul, one of the band members, Woozi, told reporters he was ""experimenting"" with AI when making music.“We practised making songs with AI, as we want to develop along with technology rather than complain about it,"" he said.""This is a technological development that we have to leverage, not just be dissatisfied with. I practised using AI and tried to look for the pros and cons.”However, Woozi has since said on Instagram that all of Seventeen\'s music is “written and composed by human creators”.', 'On K-pop discussion pages, fans were torn over the issue of using AI, with some saying more regulations need to be in place before the technology becomes normalised.Others were more open to it, including super fan Ashley Peralta. ""If AI can help an artist overcome creative blocks, then that’s OK with me,"" says the 26-year-old.Her worry though, is that a whole album of AI generated lyrics means fans will lose touch with their favourite musicians.""I love it when music is a reflection of an artist and their emotions,"" she says. ""K-pop artists are much more respected when they’re hands on with choreographing, lyric writing and composing, because you get a piece of their thoughts and feelings.""AI can take away that crucial component that connects fans to the artists.""Ashley presents Spill the Soju, a K-pop fan podcast, with her best friend Chelsea Toledo. Chelsea admires Seventeen for being a self-producing group, which means they write their own songs and choreograph them too, but she’s worried about AI having an impact on that reputation.“If they were to put out an album that’s full of lyrics they hadn’t personally written, I don’t know if it would feel like Seventeen any more and fans want music that is authentically them”.', ""For those working in K-Pop production, it’s no surprise that artists are embracing new technologies.Chris Nairn is a producer, composer and songwriter working under the name Azodi. Over the past 12 years he’s written songs for K-pop artists including Kim Woojin and leading agency SM Entertainment.Working with K-pop stars means Chris, who lives in Brighton, has spent a lot of time in South Korea, whose music industry he describes as progressive.“What I've learned by hanging out in Seoul is that Koreans are big on innovation, and they're very big on ‘what's the next thing?’, and asking, ‘how can we be one step ahead?’ It really hit me when I was there,” he says.“So, to me, it's no surprise that they're implementing AI in lyric writing, it's about keeping up with technology.”"", 'Is AI the future of K-pop? Chris isn’t so sure. As someone who experiments with AI lyric generators, he doesn’t feel the lyrics are strong enough for top artists.“AI is putting out fairly good quality stuff, but when you\'re at the top tier of the songwriting game, generally, people who do best have innovated and created something brand new. AI works by taking what’s already been uploaded and therefore can’t innovate by itself.”If anything, Chris predicts AI in K-pop will increase the demand for more personal songs.""There\'s going to be pressure from fans to hear lyrics that are from the artist\'s heart, and therefore sound different to any songs made using AI”.', 'Seventeen aren’t the only K-pop  band experimenting with AI. Girl group Aespa, who have several AI members as well as human ones, also used the technology in their latest music video. Supernova features generated scenes where the faces of band members remain still as only their mouths move.Podcaster and super-fan Chelsea says it ""triggered"" a lot of people.“K-pop is known for amazing production and editing, so having whole scenes made of AI takes away the charm,"" she adds.Chelsea also worries about artists not getting the right credit. “With AI in videos it’s harder to know if someone’s original artwork has been stolen, it’s a really touchy subject”.', ""Arpita Adhya is a music journalist and self-titled K-pop superfan. She believes the use of AI in the industry is demonstrative of the pressure artists are under to create new content.“Most recording artists will put out an album every two years, but K-pop groups are pushing out albums every six to eight months, because there’s so much hype around them.”She also believes AI has been normalised in the industry, with the introduction of AI covers which have exploded on YouTube. The cover tracks are created by fans and use technology to mimic another artist's voice.It's this kind of trend that Arpita would like to see regulated, something western artists are calling for too."", 'Just last month megastars including Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj wrote an open letter calling for the ""predatory"" use of AI in the music industry to be stopped.They called on tech firms to pledge not to develop AI music-generation tools ""that undermine or replace the human artistry of songwriters and artists, or deny us fair compensation for our work"".For Arpita, a lack of regulations means fans feel an obligation to regulate what is and isn’t OK.“Whilst there are no clear guidelines on how much artists can and can’t use AI, we have the struggle of making boundaries ourselves, and always asking ‘what is right and wrong?’”Thankfully she feels K-pop artists are aware of public opinion and hopes there will be change.“The fans are the biggest part and they have a lot of influence over artists. Groups are always keen to learn and listen, and if Seventeen and Aespa realise they are hurting their fans, they will hopefully address that.”Update 14 July 2024: This article was amended to confirm that while AI is being experimented with in K-pop, it was not used to write songs for the latest Seventeen album.']"
'Protectionism eroding global business' - world trade chief,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce93n7lgw5qo#2,The boss of the World Trade Organization warns the global economy is facing numerous challenges.,"Sun, 07 Jul 2024 23:13:17 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264653,"['Global trade “is not having the best of times at the moment”.That is the admission of the director general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. “We are seeing increasing protectionism, some undermining of the WTO rules, and some of this is leading to fragmentation,” she tells the BBC.“Global trade is really part of the lifeblood for making countries resilient - and also for underpinning growth, so we are concerned about that.”In recent weeks and months these fragmentations have come to the fore with the EU imposing provisional tariffs of up to 37.4% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). It followed after the US in May introduced 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs.Both Brussels and Washington accuse the Chinese government of unfairly subsidising its EV sector, allowing producers to export cars at unfairly low prices, and threatening jobs in the West.President Biden has also increased import taxes on a range of other Chinese products that he said formed ""the industries of the future"". These include EV batteries and the minerals they contain, the cells needed to make solar panels, and computer chips.Meanwhile, the US has been pouring billions of dollars of government money into green technology, through its Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce a reliance on Chinese imports.', 'EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis tells the BBC that Europe does not want to close the market for EVs. “We welcome imports, we welcome competition, but this competition must be fair,” he says.Last year, the volume of global trade fell for just the third time in 30 years, according to the WTO. It says the 1.2% decline was linked to higher inflation and interest rates, and is forecasting a recovery this year.However those factors have their roots in events that are continuing to fundamentally reshape the global economy,  the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath explained in a recent speech.“What we\'ve seen in the last few years, I would say, especially when it comes to global trade relations, is nothing like we\'ve seen since the end of the Cold War."" “The last few years, you\'ve had numerous shocks, including the pandemic. We had Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, and following these events, increasingly, countries around the world are guided by economic security, and national security concerns, in determining who they trade with and who they invest in,” she said.That’s affecting countries as far apart as Peru, Ghana and Vietnam as they increasingly find themselves having to choose between strengthening economic ties with the western powers, or a China-Russia axis.“We\'re also concerned about the emerging fragmentation that we see in the trade data,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. “We\'re seeing that trade between like-minded blocks is growing faster than trade across such blocks.”She warns that “it will be costly for the world” to continue down this path. WTO research has estimated that price at 5% of the global economy, whilst the IMF has suggested it could be nearer to 7% or $7.4tn (£5.8tn) of lost output in the long run.', ""The EU’s introduction of tariffs on Chinese-made EVs follows a surge in their exports to Europe over the last few years. Exports jumped from $1.6bn in value in 2020 to $11.5bn last year, according to one study, which said they now made up 37% of all EV imports into the EU.BYD, Geely and SAIC are some of the Chinese EV makers said to have benefitted from billions of dollars worth of government help.After many years of support Chinese EV companies no longer need that help, says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “They are today simply very competitive on their own terms. I think the introduction of tariffs is a symptom that something is out of balance.”When it comes to broader relationship, Mr Eskelund says it’s “mind boggling” that since 2017 the volume of goods that the EU has sold to China has fallen about a third, even though China’s economy has been growing steadily.Citing Chinese restrictions around market access for overseas firms, and tough security regulations, he adds: “I think it's fair to say that that Europe still remains a significantly more open market to Chinese companies, then the other way around. And that is obviously something that needs to change.”The chamber’s recent survey showed that members have the lowest confidence on record for investing in China."", ""It comes as the EU is trying to lower its economic dependence on China. European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen last year described the need to “de-risk not de-couple” its relations with China.Brussels' concerns include Beijing using sensitive technology for military purposes, and its support for Russia as it continues its offensive in Ukraine.Companies including Ikea, Nike and Apple are also trying to become less reliant on China.Whilst the EU and China are set to hold talks about the potential EV tariffs, Chinese state media has reported that retaliatory measures are being considered on EU goods including pork, cognac and luxury cars."", 'However, there are other barriers for global trade to overcome, including in two of the most important arteries for moving goods around the world.This year Panama Canal officials had to reduce the number of ships allowed to traverse the waterway. This is due to a lack of rainfall to fill the lake that feeds the canal.Meanwhile, the Suez Canal is effectively cut off because of ongoing attacks on commercial ships by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. Traffic through the canal is down 90%, according to logistics firm Kuehne+Nagel.Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of the German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd, says this disruption means that the rates his firm charges are up between 30% and 40%.Whilst shipping costs are a small part of retail prices, Mr Habben Jansen says “these extra costs in the end get passed on” to consumers. That could end up pushing inflation up just as central banks are showing signs of getting it under control.That would be “detrimental to consumers,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala.Despite all the tensions, she says trade has shown signs of resilience, and she adds that her organization can help countries solve their differences.Meanwhile, Dr Okonjo-Iweala admits that some WTO rules will need to change to help meet the challenge of climate change.  “I strongly believe that some of our [global trade] rules, we do need to look at them,"" she says.“When they were put in place, decades ago, we were not confronting the kind of climate change threats we confront today.”Regarding the increased use of tariffs, she adds: “We hope we don\'t have a repeat of what we saw in the 1930s. We had retaliatory tariffs, and it was downhill from there and everyone lost.“So I do hope we will not enter into that kind of era again”.', '']"
Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kk4lxe702o#2,A Texas start-up is developing cargo gliders that would be towed behind a jet.,"Thu, 04 Jul 2024 23:05:00 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264769,"['US start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing.Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them.At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo.Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft.Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft.Their latest test aircraft is known as the “flying piano” because of its poor gliding characteristics. Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes.Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line.They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.', ""Aerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel.One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously.The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft’s engines.In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls “a combination of gliding and surfing”.The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic.Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350’s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn."", 'Mr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years’ experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi and Doron Appelboim, veterans of Amazon’s drone delivery project, on the basis that “there has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft"". The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations.For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population.Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by.', 'Mr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project. “We’ve engaged outside advisors to be devil’s advocates,"" he adds.He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery. On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots.James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something.“It stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.”However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely.“It should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.”', 'Regulators are likely to be cautious as well, particularly in the US, where the Federal Aviation Authority is under pressure after serious problems with Boeing aircraft.Mr Graetz replies that his team has complied with every request from the FAA so far. “The FAA has always been super risk averse. That’s their business!”Fred Lopez spent 36 years in aviation operations at cargo giant UPS. As he says, he’s put  “my entire adult life” into working out the most cost-effective way to operate an air freight business.Mr Lopez admits he was profoundly sceptical about cargo gliders when Aerolane first approached him. But the prospect of serious fuel savings won him over and now he sits on their advisory board.Cutting fuel costs is an obsession in civil aviation. When the upturned wing-tips we see out of a cabin window became a standard design feature airlines cut fuel costs by around 5%.But gliders only consume the fuel required by their tow plane. If that too is a cargo aircraft, a pair of gliders drawn by one jet represents a significant reduction in fuel consumption on a large shipment.The initial Aerolane design uses their autopilot plus what Mr Lopez terms a human “safety pilot”. This should make certification from the FAA easier.“Aerolane is not trying to change everything at one go” he says.Their ultimate goal is autonomous operation using AI, or as Mr Lopez puts it “to pull the pilot out of the seat"".And, if the flying piano can surf, then who knows what\'s possible?']"
Would having an AI boss be better than your current human one?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c03lgz2zrg1o#2,Companies are now experimenting with using AI systems to manage their staff.,"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 23:09:47 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.264894,"[""With the stress of managing 83 employees taking its toll, Hannu Rauma was feeling discouraged and frustrated.“I was getting too bogged down in all these things that were going wrong amongst the teams, and feeling this disappointment,” says Mr Rauma, who is based in Vancouver, Canada.He is a senior manager at a company called Student Marketing Agency, which employs university students to provide marketing support for small businesses.“When I was bringing new clients on board, half of my mind would be saying, ‘we're going to screw up’, and it would dampen my enthusiasm.”"", ""But Mr Rauma says that all changed from last November, when the firm began using an autonomous AI manager developed by US-based company Inspira.The AI manager helps the agency’s employees, who work flexible hours remotely, to set their schedules and plan their workloads in advance.It checks their timekeeping, sends them deadline reminders and regular check-in messages, and records the time spent on different clients, so the latter can be billed accurately. The AI also makes suggestions to improve the wording of written text, is available to answer work-related questions, and automatically updates everyone’s work progress in a central portal.Mr Rauma says that the shift towards an AI manager has not only reduced his stress levels, but has enabled his employees to work faster and be more productive. “I'm able to focus on the growth of the company and all the positive things. It's added years to my life, I'm sure,” he says.Mr Rauma adds that his relationships with his employees have also improved drastically. “Before, it felt a lot like a father-child situation. Now, we're more on an equal footing. Before, it was only about solving problems. But now we’re able to have more light-hearted discussions.”"", 'But not everyone at Student Marketing Agency is using the AI manager yet. Mr Rauma and 26 of his 83 employees were actually part of a study run by Inspira and academics from Columbia University, Arizona State University, and the University of Wisconsin to compare the performance of the AI manager with its human counterparts.Participants were divided into three groups: one coached by a human manager, another by the AI manager, and the last group by both AI and human manager.The AI manager achieved a 44% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays in advance, and was able to motivate the employees to log in on time 42% of the time. These figures were comparable to the human manager, who achieved scores of 45% and 44% for those two areas.Yet when the AI manager worked in partnership with a human manager, together they achieved a 72% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays, and managed to achieve 46% on-time success.Despite the study being statistically small, and concentrated on a specific type of worker and field, its results point to interesting implications for companies introducing AI tools.', ""While businesses like UPS, Dell and others have announced significant job cuts this year, with the intention of replacing many roles with AI, Prof Paul Thurman, from Columbia University in New York, argues that swapping management roles completely for AI would be a mistake.“The middle management layer is the most critical layer in any organisation,” says the professor of management. “They're the layer that, if it starts turning over, you're in for a wild ride. Your people don't see continuity, they don't get mentoring and coaching… all the human things that human managers are better at than AI and should be focusing on.”AI, Prof Thurman adds, can liberate managers from endless reminding and checking in, to focus on more innovative ways of working. For example, managers can cherry pick project teams based on individual skillsets, oversee the brief, then hand over to their AI to manage minutiae like deadlines.AI can also identify who in the team is falling behind and may need to be managed more closely by a human, and by the same token, hone in on star performers who require extra recognition.But companies should steer away from AI managers becoming a surveillance tool, he says.“You don’t want to get to a point where you are noting that, not only do people not clock in on time, but they take too much time at lunch, and they're not eating enough salad. You don't want to go that far,” says Prof Thurman. “You want to find the right way to encourage the right behaviours.”"", ""AI managers can also help people who have become “accidental managers” - people who excel in their roles and end up managing people as a result, despite management not being a natural skill for them, says Tina Rahman, founder of London-based HR consultancy, HR Habitat.“We did a study which looked at the reasons people leave a job. Almost 100% of the respondents said it was because of bad management.“Some of them said they didn’t like the way they'd been managed, and most of them also said it was because they didn’t know what was expected of them or if they were doing a good job,” says Ms Rahman.“You'd assume that an AI manager would be built to give those correct instructions, to give complete transparency on the requirements, and the outcomes. People are likely to be more productive when they know what's expected of them.”But an over-reliance on AI management sets the tone that companies only care about output and not people, Ms Rahman warns.“It’s going to be very hard for a business to tell their employees that they’re introducing this brand new AI system that's going to completely manage them, then say, with the same face, that ‘we care about your experiences in the workplace,’” she says."", ""Yet perhaps the biggest concern about AI managers is not from a people perspective, but from a cybersecurity one, warns James Bore, managing director of cybersecurity consultancy, Bores, and speaker and author.“If you have an AI manager, and you've given them all of the company's processes, procedures, and intellectual property that is suddenly all in the software, it can be kidnapped by someone who wants to clone it, and it could also be held to ransom,” says Mr Bore.“If you've come to rely on it, which companies will when they start replacing humans with AI, you're kind of stuck, because you've got no resilience, no option to switch back to the humans, because you don't have them anymore.”Rather than companies becoming more efficient through an extensive use of AI, Mr Bore says there could be an unintended consequence beyond becoming dependent on systems that could fail.“The more you automate, and the more you remove people from your business, yes, you'll bring down costs. But you will also make your company more replaceable.”""]"
How Microsoft and Nvidia bet correctly to leapfrog Apple,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nglq80w7eo#2,The two tech firms were among the first to see the commercial potential of AI.,"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 23:05:03 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265013,"['Life comes at you fast.Last month, AI chip giant Nvidia briefly became the world’s richest company, overtaking Microsoft, which had in turn risen above Apple.When this news was mentioned on stage at a tech industry event I attended in Copenhagen, there was spontaneous applause from the audience.As I write, Nvidia is now back in second place, after a fall in its share price took its combined value down to $3tn (£2.4tn) compared with $3.4tn for Microsoft.Two things have propelled these two US tech titans to such a dizzying pinnacle: AI and foresight.Microsoft started investing in OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019. Meanwhile, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang pushed his company towards AI chip development many years before generative AI exploded onto the scene.Both firms took a long-term bet on the current AI boom – and so far, it’s paid off, leaving former top-dog Apple trailing in their wake. But how long will it last?', 'This year’s London Tech Week, an annual event for the UK tech scene, may as well have been called London AI Week. The letters AI were emblazoned on every stand, and uttered in every speech.I bumped into Anne Boden, the founder of Starling Bank, a significant fintech disruptor. She was buzzing with excitement.“We thought we knew who the winners and losers were [in tech],” she told me. “But with AI, we are throwing the dice again”.She believes she’s watching the AI revolution re-landscape the tech sector, and she wants to dive back in.That same week I also popped along to Founders Forum, an annual gathering of around 250 high-level entrepreneurs and investors. Some serious money, in other words. It’s a confidential event, but I don’t think I’ll get into too much trouble for saying that much of the chat there was also centred around AI.A few days after that, a headline in the Financial Times caught my eye. “Most stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,” it read, claiming that more than half of the stocks in Citigroup’s “AI winners basket” had fallen in value in 2024.Life comes at you fast indeed.', '“Given how high valuations have leapt for tech companies, missteps ahead could cause big wobbles in share prices,” warns Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.“Just like the dot.com bubble, over-enthusiasm risks spilling over into disappointment.”In 2023 you’d have been forgiven for thinking that anything with the acronym AI in it was guaranteed to open up a lucrative seam of funding, with investment dollars flooding into all things AI.My friend Saurabh Dayal, who is based in Scotland, identifies AI projects for his pharmaceutical firm to potentially collaborate on. He said he soon grew tired of misleading pitches.“I spend a lot of time saying ‘… but that’s not AI’,” he tells me.It seems both investors and clients are finally growing wiser to the term AI, and, as a result, more picky.', 'Speaking to the FT, Citi’s Stuart Kaiser said that while AI remained a big theme in the world of stocks and shares, “just saying AI 15 times isn’t going to cut it anymore”.In addition, there is increased awareness of current generative AI products not exactly living up to their own hype. Inaccuracies, misinformation, displays of bias, copyright infringements and some content that’s just plain weird.And early AI-enabled physical devices like the Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin have received bad reviews.“We’re seeing the market around generative AI mature a little right now – early experiments set a lot of grand expectations, but when the rubber hit the road there were too many unexpected outcomes,” says Chris Weston, chief digital and information officer of the tech service firm Jumar.“Businesses have a lot of value tied up in goodwill – the trust and comfort that their clients have in their services. Introducing ungovernable chatbots is a step too far for many right now.”Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore agrees that the pressure is on for AI firms to deliver on their promises. “The bubble will burst the moment one of the giants fails to show any meaningful growth from AI,” he says.But he does not believe that is going to happen any time soon.“Everyone is still jostling for position, and all companies are pinning their strategies on AI,” he adds.“All the players are ramping up their activities, increasing spend and claiming early successes.”', ""There’s another reason why the AI bubble might pop. It’s got nothing to do with the quality of the products or their market value. It’s whether the planet itself can afford it.A study published last year predicted that the AI industry could consume the same amount of energy of a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027 if growth continues at its current rate.I interviewed Prof Kate Crawford from the University of Southern California for the BBC’s Tech Life podcast, and she told me that worrying about the amount of electricity, energy and water required to power AI kept her awake at night. Dr Sasha Luccioni from the machine-learning firm Hugging Face is also concerned.“There’s simply not enough renewable energy to power AI right now – most of that bubble is fuelled by oil and gas,” she says.The hope is that the tech could be used to identify sustainability solutions, like for example the secret of nuclear fusion, the way in which the sun gets its energy. But that hasn’t happened yet, and in the meantime, “AI systems put a huge strain on energy grids that are already under immense strain,” adds Dr Luccioni.With so much uncertainty, few should bet against another shake-up among the world's richest firms. But currently, Apple has a fight on its hands to catch up with Microsoft and Nvidia in the AI race.""]"
The fastest data in the world,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clkkllxm4jzo#2,Researchers are seeing how fast data can be delivered amid rising demand for bandwidth.,"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 23:02:51 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265128,"['As IT updates go, this was about as nerve-wracking as things can get.In February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) – the world’s biggest science experiment – two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button.Suddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. “There was high-fiving involved,” recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. “It was super-cool to see.”He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands.A data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) – or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists’ access to the results of LHC experiments.A subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable.“This transponder that Nokia uses, it’s like a celebrity,” says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. “We had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.”This amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still – they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.', 'In labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection.This is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster.The duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. “Due to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,” explains Mr Opdenakker.Every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data – about one petabyte per second. That’s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs.This is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today.“The upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,” says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.', 'A time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That’s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work.In this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors.He also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores – a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people’s home to the internet.', 'But older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That’s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection.“I think it’s a world best, we don’t know of any results that are better than that,” says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line.For this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself.Activities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030.But reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications. “For remote robotic surgery across 3,000 miles… you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down,” says Mr Creaner.Dr Okonkwo adds that training AI will increasingly require moving huge datasets around. The faster this can be done, the better, he argues.And Ian Phillips, who works alongside Prof Forysiak, says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available: “Humanity finds a way of consuming it.”', 'Although multiple petabits per second is far beyond what today’s web users need, Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm, says it is striking how quickly demand for bandwidth is growing – currently, at around 30% year-on-year on transatlantic fibre optic cables.Content provision – social media, cloud services, video streaming – is eating up far more bandwidth than before, she notes: “It used to be like 15% of international bandwidth in the early 2010’s. Now it’s up to three quarters, 75%. It’s absolutely massive.”In the UK, there is still a long way to go to improve internet speeds. Many people cannot access sufficiently fast broadband at home.Andrew Kernahan, head of public affairs at the Internet Service Providers Association says most home users can now access gigabit per second speeds.However, only about a third of broadband customers are signing up for such technology. There’s no “killer app” at the moment that really requires it, says Mr Kernahan. This might change as more and more TV is consumed via the internet, for example.“There’s definitely a challenge to get the message out there and make people more aware of what they can do with the infrastructure,” he says.']"

You then get automatically billed.However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.', 'Amazon was quick to claim that the reports were “erroneous”, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops.Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that “this is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common”.Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question – whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed “AI washing” in reference to the environmental ""green washing"".', 'But first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information.The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called ""generative AI"". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images.Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google\'s Gemini, and Microsoft\'s Copilot are popular examples of generative AI.When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they\'re actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not.Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software.While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year.And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities.""Some founders seem to believe that if they don’t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,"" says Mr Ayangar.""And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.""', 'It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from  another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures. In a 2019 study it found that 40% of new tech firms that described themselves as ""AI start-ups"" in fact used virtually no AI at all.""The problem is the same today, plus a different problem,"" says Simon Menashy, general partner at MMC Ventures.He explains that ""cutting-edge AI capabilities"" are now available for every company to buy for the price of standard software. But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.', 'Douglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI.""If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,” he says. “The term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge.""AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve.""Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies.And, says Mr Ayangar: ""If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.""', 'Regulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI.""The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,"" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.', 'In the UK, rules and laws covering AI washing are already in place, including the Advertising Standards Authority\'s (ASA\'s) code of conduct, which states that marketing communications must not materially mislead, or be likely to do so.Michael Cordeaux, associate in the regulatory team at UK corporate law firm Walker Morris, says that AI claims have become an increasingly common feature of advertisements subject to ASA investigation.Examples include a paid-for Instagram post about an app captioned ""Enhance your Photos with AI"", which was held by the ASA to be exaggerating the performance of the app, and was therefore misleading.""What is clear is that AI claims are becoming increasingly prevalent and, presumably, effective at piquing consumer interest,"" says Mr Cordeaux.“In my opinion we are at the peak of the AI hype cycle,” says Sandra Wachter, a professor of technology and regulation at Oxford University, and a leading global expert on AI.“However, I feel that we have forgotten to ask if it always makes sense to use AI for all types of tasks. I remember seeing advertisements in the London Tube for electric toothbrushes that are powered by AI. Who is this for? Who is helped by this?""Also, the environmental impact of AI is often glossed over, she says.“AI does not grow on trees… the technology already contributes more to climate change than aviation. We have to move away from this one-sided overhyped discussion, and really think about specific tasks and sectors that AI can be beneficial for, and not just blindly implement it into everything.”But in the longer term, says Advika Jalan, head of research at MMC Ventures, the problem of AI washing may subside on its own.""AI is becoming so ubiquitous - even if they’re just ChatGPT wrappers - that \'AI-powered\' as a branding tool will likely cease to be a differentiator after some time,"" she says. ""It will be a bit like saying \'we’re on the internet\'.""']"
The screen tech that can do almost anything,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nn6z6z4ypo#2,New technology promises TV and phone screens that use much less electricity than current models.,"Mon, 24 Jun 2024 23:02:12 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265376,"['At first glance, it looks like a relic from the 1980s. A tiny computer screen with flickering, low-resolution text scrolling across it. But this could be the future.The screen was made using perovskite light emitting diode (PeLED) technology. It is radically different to the LED technology used in your smartphone display today, and it could lead to devices that are thinner, cheaper and have longer battery life.Not only that, PeLEDs are very unusual in that they can absorb light as well as emit it, meaning you can use the same material to integrate touch, fingerprint and ambient light-sensing capabilities, says Feng Gao at Linköping University in Sweden.“This is difficult but we think it’s possible.""In today’s smartphones, such functions are carried out by electronic components separate to a phone’s screen itself. In a paper published in April, Prof Gao and colleagues demonstrated their prototype with touch and ambient light sensitivity already working.“It’s a very nice demonstration… it’s very new,” says Daniele Braga, head of sales and marketing for Fluxim, a technology research firm in Switzerland. Though he notes that optimising all the different functions promised here might make it difficult to commercialise this kind of display quickly.Via video call, Prof Gao shows off the latest version of the technology. It is another small screen, but this time the pixels per inch (ppi), a measurement of the sharpness of the display, has been nearly doubled – at 90 ppi.On the screen, a simple animation plays, showing two stick figures fighting. A paper with further details about this prototype has just been published.', 'Perovskite the mineral contains calcium, titanium and oxygen arranged in a crystal structure. It was discovered in the 1800s, but people later realised that they could make other kinds of perovskites that shared the same structure while having different elements or molecules as the components.Depending on the materials chosen, perovskites can be really good at, for example, conducting electricity or emitting light.“By slightly tuning the chemical composition you can cover the full visible spectrum,” says Dr Braga, explaining that making perovskites is a relatively simple and cheap process. “If you think about mass production, this is gigantic.”There are some problems, though. PeLEDs are notoriously unstable – they go bad with exposure to moisture or oxygen, for instance. Loreta Muscarella at VU Amsterdam, a university, is working to develop new kinds of PeLEDs.She says that if you leave a PeLED lying around for a few hours or days, the colour of light it emits will gradually degrade or shift to a less pure version of, say, green, than the green you want.And this undermines the whole point of perovskites. They are desirable in part because they can be tuned to emit a very specific, very pure form of red, green or blue – the key hues required for full colour digital displays.', 'To keep them stable, PeLEDs can be encapsulated in glue or resin, says Prof Gao. But researchers are still working on ensuring that the technology does not falter over a long period.Dr Muscarella says that traditional LEDs have lifetimes of 50,000 hours or more whereas PeLED lifespans are still in the hundreds to thousands of hours range.It could be years before you buy a commercial product that contains a PeLED, she adds.But there’s a different type of light-emitting perovskite that you might see on the market first.It relies on photoluminescence. This isn’t an LED as such but rather a filter or film-like material that absorbs and re-emits light in a particular colour.In some TV’s on the market today, a coloured filter supplies the crucial red, green and blue colours used in every pixel on the screen.It’s by mixing those colours at different levels that you can get the range of hues required to display a full picture.The red, green and blue filters are lit up by an LED backlight. But today’s filters actually block a lot of that light.Photoluminescent perovskites, in contrast, let almost all the light through, which would mean a big increase in brightness and efficiency.Helio, a British company, is working on this. A video on their website shows how a red or green coloured perovskite film can re-emit blue light as either red or green almost perfectly.', 'The technology Prof Gao and his colleagues are developing is quite different. They are experimenting with screens that emit light using LEDs which are themselves made with perovskites.These are known as electroluminescent perovskites. Working with them is tricky because they are sensitive to electrical fields and, as mentioned, aren’t very stable. But eventually they could be even more efficient options for lighting up the red, green and blue pixels in a smartphone, tablet or TV screen without any need for colour filters at all.The main advantages of switching to this technology could be in lowering the cost of these devices and in reducing their energy consumption.No-one is quite sure how much less energy a future PeLED display might consume versus, say, an OLED screen, but lab experiments suggest that PeLEDs are already competitive with OLEDs and could one day significantly exceed them in terms of efficiency, says Dr Muscarella.', 'Prof Sir Richard Friend, at the University of Cambridge, is one of the co-founders of Helio, along with Prof Henry Snaith at the University of Oxford. He points out that one of the challenges with PeLEDs is in getting them to emit light in the right direction. This really matters for displays.“You need to get light emitted in the forward direction rather than getting stuck going sideways,” he explains.Researchers are experimenting with many different techniques to address this problem. Dr Muscarella and colleagues have tried imprinting a bumpy nanoscale pattern on the surface of PeLEDs, for example, which appears to improve light emission.For Prof Gao, however, who has published alongside Prof Sir Friend and who received his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 2011, the promise of PeLED screens that do so much more than emit light is beckoning.From fingerprint verification to heart-rate sensing and light detection, it could all one day be done using single slab of layered materials with the all-important light-absorbing perovskite in the middle.“It’s really very unique,” he says, enthusing. “This is not possible with other LED technologies.”']"
Huge Saudi construction projects 'might get scaled down',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyrr3mm8evyo#2,Funding concerns are expected to see Saudi Arabia reduce its giant building schemes.,"Sun, 23 Jun 2024 23:03:08 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265490,"['“They can keep saying that, and we can keep proving them wrong.”That was the response of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a TV documentary broadcast in July 2023, while talking about scepticism surrounding Saudi Arabia’s flagship construction projects.Almost a year later, some of the doubts are turning out to be true.In recent months, Saudi Arabia has seemingly scaled back plans for its vast desert development project Neom, which is the centrepiece of Vision 2030.This is the economic diversification programme spearheaded by Prince Mohammed, the Gulf state’s de-facto ruler, to transition the country’s economy away from oil-dependency.As well as Neom, Saudi Arabia is also developing 13 other large construction schemes, or “giga projects” as they are referred, worth trillions of dollars. These include an entertainment city on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh, multiple luxury island resorts on the Red Sea, and a cluster of other tourist and cultural destinations.', 'But low oil prices have impacted government revenues, forcing Riyadh to reassess these projects, and explore new funding strategies.An advisor, who is associated with the government but wished not to be named, tells the BBC that the projects are being reviewed, with a decision expected soon.“The decision will be based on multiple factors,” he says. “But there is no doubt that there will be a recalibration. Some projects will proceed as planned, but some might get delayed or scaled down.”Announced in 2017, Neom is a $500bn (£394bn) plan to build 10 futuristic cities in a desert region in the north west of the country.The most ambitious of them, and the one that has gained all the headlines, is The Line. This will be a linear city consisting of two adjoined, parallel skyscraper walls standing 500m high - taller than the Empire State Building. Yet they will have combined width of just 200m, including the gap between them.', ""The original plan was that they would extend for 170km (105 miles), and become home to nine million inhabitants.But according to people familiar with the details – and as already leaked to the press - the project developers will now focus on completing just 2.4km by 2030, as part of the first module.When The Line was first announced it was billed as a “carbon-free linear city” that would redefine urban living, with amenities for residents like parks, waterfalls, flying taxis, and robot maids.The city would have no roads or cars, and would be made up of interconnected, pedestrianised communities. It would also include an ultra-high-speed train, with a maximum journey duration of 20 minutes anywhere within city limits.How many of these features will be part of the first phase are unclear.Along with The Line, Neom is also due to include an octagon-shaped floating industrial city, and a mountain ski-resort that will host the Asian Winter Games in 2029.Ali Shihabi, a former banker now on Neom's advisory board, says the targets set for projects under Vision 2030 were deliberately “designed to be over ambitious”.“It was meant to be over ambitious, with the clear understanding that only a part of it would be delivered on time. But even that part would be significant,” says Mr Shihabi."", 'The scaling back of Neom has put the spotlight on the funding challenges that the Saudi government is facing.Neom is being paid for by the Saudi government through its sovereign wealth entity, the Public Investment Fund (PIF).The official cost to build Neom, $500bn, is 50% more than the country’s entire federal budget for the year. But analysts estimate that it would ultimately cost more than $2tn to execute the full project.Saudi Arabia’s government budget has been in a deficit since late 2022, when the world’s largest oil exporter began slashing production to accelerate global prices. The government has forecast a deficit of $21bn for this year.The PIF is feeling the pinch. It controls assets of about $900bn, but it had just $15bn in cash reserves as of September.', 'Tim Callen, the former IMF chief to Saudi Arabia and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, says that raising capital for Neom and other large-scale projects is a key challenge in the future.“It is going to be increasingly challenging to fund the PIF to the levels that are required for these projects,” Mr Callen says.The Gulf state is tapping other avenues to shore up capital.Earlier this month, it sold roughly $11.2bn worth of shares in its national oil company Saudi Aramco. Most of those proceeds are expected to go to the PIF, which was also the biggest beneficiary when the company went public in 2019.The sale comes amid volatility in oil prices. In July of last year, in an attempt to bolster prices, the Saudi Arabia-led OPEC+ oil producing group of countries curbed production.Riyadh voluntarily cut its supplies by one million barrels a day. However, this month, OPEC+ reversed the decision, and it will gradually start increasing production from October.', 'According to the International Monetary Fund, the price of a barrel of oil needs to be $96.20 for Saudi Arabia to be able to balance its budget. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for crude, has been hovering around $80 a barrel.The country has also relied on selling government bonds to maintain funding flows for the PIF. The other challenge has been that foreign direct investment has remained far below targets, underlining Riyadh’s struggle to attract funding from private companies and international investors.‘It’s going to be very difficult to persuade investors to come into projects that they view as being overly ambitious,” says Mr Callen. “It’s unclear where your returns will ultimately come from.”The Gulf state is also funnelling money into sectors such as tourism, mining, entertainment, and sports as part of the economic diversification strategy.In recent years, Saudi Arabia has won the hosting rights for several major international events, such as the football Asian Cup in 2027, Asian Winter Games in 2029, and the World Expo 2030. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for the 2034 FIFA Men’s World Cup. All these projects will require massive investments in the years to come.', 'Mr Shihabi expects the government to prioritise these international events as they get closer. “Projects where we have specific deadlines to meet will get prioritized by the nature of things,” he says.In April, at a special meeting of the World Economic Forum meeting held in Riyadh, the country’s Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said the government didn’t have an “ego”, and would adjust its Vision 2030 plan to transform its economy as needed.“We will change course, we will extend some of the projects, we will downscale some projects, we will accelerate some projects,” he said.', '']"
How mobile phone networks are embracing AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6pp1nvw5zwo#2,Providers are increasing using artificial intelligence to maintain a reliable service.,"Wed, 19 Jun 2024 23:02:43 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265603,"['Our mobile phones are getting a whole lot smarter, but what about the telecoms networks they run on?Last week, Apple became the latest mobile phone firm to announce that it will be adding artificial intelligence (AI) to its handsets’ operating system.Called Apple Intelligence, and also due to be incorporated into the phones’ Siri chatbot, it aims to make them easier and quicker to use. And turn Siri into even more of a personal assistant.It follows after Samsung’s Galaxy AI, and Google’s Gemini AI for its own Pixel handsets.This increased of use AI means phones will be doing a lot more computing, and that means they’ll produce and use a lot more data. This is going to put more strain on the mobile phone networks, such as the UK’s O2, EE, Vodafone and Three.', 'To help them cope, telecoms firms such as these are also increasingly introducing AI, says Ian Fogg, director of network innovation at research consultancy CCS Insight.“Network operators are using AI to manage the radio frequencies dynamically, to provide an optimum level of service. And to manage cell towers, for example, so they use less energy at times of lower demand.""Such increased use of AI to look after mobile phone networks is now very much global. In South Korea, Korea Telecom is now able to localise and fix faults within a minute, thanks to AI-enabled network monitoring, says Alex Sinclair, chief technology officer of the GSMA, the body representing global mobile operators.Meanwhile, AT&T in the US is using predictive, AI algorithms schooled on trillions of previous network alerts to warn it when things are about to go wrong.', 'Other operators, like Vodafone, are using AI digital twins - virtual digital replicas of real-world equipment, such as masts and antennas – to constantly monitor how their networks are performing.And AI is also being used to manage how increasingly massive data centres use energy to keep their servers cool and optimise storage capacity.The explosion in data created by the increased use of AI is another reason why telecoms firms around the world are continuing to invest in so-called 5G Standalone mobile networks. These use new, dedicated 5G infrastructure rather than relying in part on upgrading the older, less efficient 4G system.5G Standalone offers much higher speeds and capacity. But some experts believe that even this higher-spec technology won’t be sufficient to cope with the demands of the AI era.At this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, for example, some experts argued that AI won’t be able to reach its full potential until the roll out of 6G from 2028.', 'While mobile customers only tend to notice the network when things go wrong, they are much more aware when customer service levels are poor, with all the reputational damage this can cause brands.So the industry is also hoping AI can radically improve the way they interact with and serve customers.For example, the Global Telco AI Alliance - a joint venture company made up of Deutsche Telekom, e&, Singtel, Softbank and SK Telecom with 1.3 billion customers across 50 countries – aims to develop an AI chatbot specifically tailored to the telecoms sector, and the type of questions customers typically ask.This specially trained chatbot will be able to deal with most of the basic queries coming from customers, leaving call centre staff free to concentrate on more complex cases, the Alliance’s founders hope.', 'Meanwhile, Vodafone has teamed up with Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to improve its customer service, spearheaded by its digital assistant Tobi, which interacts with more than 40 million customers a month in 13 countries and across 15 languages.The more Tobi can answer customer queries without the need for human intervention, the fewer complaints there are likely to be, which is good for profits and corporate reputation.“We see AI primarily as a ‘virtual assistant’ for humans,” says Scott Petty, Vodafone’s chief technology officer. “We already see AI freeing-up Vodafone employees’ time from tedious, repetitive manual work, enabling them to focus on more creative activities that benefit our customers and the environment.”AI also leaves the customer agents freer to work on more complex cases, he argues. Vodafone also says that Azure OpenAI is helping customers more easily find what they’re looking for on its websites, with early evidence showing a doubling in the number of successful completed online customer journeys, and a 10% reduction in follow-up calls.', 'While many commentators worry that AI could lead to massive job losses in the telco sector, as menial tasks are increasingly automated by software, GSMA’s Mr Sinclair believes it could actually be empowering, particularly for lower-income countries.“AI will give emerging markets a specialist tool to help them catch up,” he argues. “We’re in favour of trying to democratise AI so that it’s not just the wealthy who can use it.”He believes that some of the doom-mongering around AI has been overdone, and so he strikes a more optimistic tone.It’s a view shared by CCS Insight’s Ian Fogg: “AI has been around for some years, used for specific [telecoms] cases. But now it’s being applied in many more areas - network, devices, software - such that every tool we use now has the potential to become much, much better.“AI has the potential to make networks greener, and the world a more efficient place.”']"
Could brain-like computers be a 'competition killer'?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx99qv2w1ddo#2,Computers built like brains could be much more energy efficient than current designs.,"Mon, 17 Jun 2024 23:24:11 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265721,"[""Modern computing's appetite for electricity is increasing at an alarming rate.By 2026 consumption by data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency could be as much as double 2022 levels, according to a recent report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).It estimates that in 2026 energy consumption by those three sectors could be roughly equivalent to Japan's annual energy needs.Companies like Nvidia - whose computer chips underpin most AI applications today - are working on developing more energy efficient hardware.But could an alternative path be to build computers with a fundamentally different type of architecture, one that is more energy efficient?Some firms certainly think so, and are drawing on the structure and function of an organ which uses a fraction of the power of a conventional computer to perform more operations faster: the brain."", ""In neuromorphic computing, electronic devices imitate neurons and synapses, and are interconnected in a way that resembles the electrical network of the brain.It isn't new - researchers have been working on the technique since the 1980s.But the energy requirements of the AI revolution are increasing the pressure to get the nascent technology into the real world.Current systems and platforms exist primarily as research tools, but proponents say they could provide huge gains in energy efficiency, Amongst those with commercial ambitions include hardware giants like Intel and IBM.A handful of small companies are also on the scene. “The opportunity is there waiting for the company that can figure this out,” says Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights. “[And] the opportunity is such that it could be an Nvidia killer”."", 'In May SpiNNcloud Systems, a spinout of the Dresden University of Technology, announced it will begin selling neuromorphic supercomputers for the first time, and is taking pre-orders.“We have reached the commercialisation of neuromorphic supercomputers in front of other companies,” says Hector Gonzalez, its co-chief executive.It is a significant development says Tony Kenyon, a professor of nanoelectronic and nanophotonic materials at University College London who works in the field.“While there still isn’t a killer app… there are lots of areas where neuromorphic computing will provide significant gains in energy efficiency and performance, and I’m sure we’ll start to see wide adoption of the technology as it matures,” he says.', 'Neuromorphic computing covers a range of approaches - from simply a more brain-inspired approach, to a near-total simulation of the human brain (which we are really nowhere near).But there are some basic design properties that set it apart from conventional computing.First, unlike conventional computers, neuromorphic computers don’t have separate memory and processing units. Instead, those tasks are performed together on one chip in a single location.Removing that need to transfer data between the two reduces the energy used and speeds up processing time, notes Prof Kenyon.Also common can be an event-driven approach to computing.In contrast to conventional computing where every part of the system is always on and available to communicate with any other part all the time, activation in neuromorphic computing can be sparser.The imitation neurons and synapses only activate in a moment of time when they have something to communicate, much the same way plenty of neurons and synapses in our brains only spring into action where there is a reason.Doing work only when there is something to process also saves power.And while modern computers are digital – using 1s or 0s to represent data -  a neuromorphic computing can be analogue. Historically important, that method of computing relies on continuous signals and can be useful where data coming from the outside world needs to be analysed.However, for reasons of ease, most commercially oriented neuromorphic efforts are digital.', 'Commercial applications envisaged fall into two main categories.One, which is where SpiNNcloud is focused, is in providing a more energy efficient and higher performance platform for AI applications – including image and video analysis, speech recognition and the large-language models that power chatbots such as ChatGPT.Another is in ""edge computing"" applications – where data is processed not in the cloud, but in real time on connected devices, but which operate on power constraints. Autonomous vehicles, robots, cell phones and wearable technology could all benefit.Technical challenges, however, remain. Long regarded as a main stumbling block to the advance of neuromorphic computing generally is developing the software needed for the chips to run.While having the hardware is one thing, it must be programmed to work, and that can require developing from scratch a totally different style of programming to that used by conventional computers. “The potential for these devices is huge… the problem is how do you make them work,” sums up Mr Hutcheson, who predicts it will be at least a decade, if not two, before the benefits of neuromorphic computing are really felt.There are also issues with cost. Whether they use silicon, as the commercially oriented efforts do, or other materials, creating radically new chips is expensive, notes Prof Kenyon.', ""Intel’s current prototype neuromorphic chip is called Loihi 2.In April, the company announced it had brought together 1,152 of them to create Hala Point, a large-scale neuromorphic research system comprising more than 1.15 billion fake neurons and 128 billion fake synapses.With a neuron capacity roughly equivalent to an owl brain, Intel claims is the world’s largest system to date.At the moment it is still a research project for Intel. “[But Hala Point] is showing that there's some real viability here for applications to use AI,” says Mike Davies, director of Intel’s neuromorphic computing lab. About the size of a microwave oven, Hala Point is “commercially relevant” and “rapid progress” is being made on the software side, he says. "", 'IBM calls its latest brain-inspired prototype chip NorthPole.Unveiled last year, it is an evolution of its previous TrueNorth prototype chip. Tests show it is more energy efficient, space efficient and faster than any chip currently on the market, says Dharmendra Modha, the company’s chief scientist of brain-inspired computing.  He adds that his group is now working to demonstrate chips can be dialed together into a larger system.“Path to market will be at story to come,” he says. One of the big innovations with NorthPole, notes Dr Modha, is that it has been co-designed with the software so the full capabilities of the architecture can be exploited from the get-go.Other smaller neuromorphic companies include BrainChip, SynSense and Innatera.', 'SpiNNcloud’s supercomputer commercialises neuromorphic computing developed by researchers at both TU Dresden and the University of Manchester, under the umbrella of the EU’s Human Brain Project.Those efforts have resulted in two research-purpose neuromorphic supercomputers: the SpiNNaker1 machine based at the University of Manchester consisting of over one billion neurons, and operational since 2018.A second generation SpiNNaker2 machine at TU Dresden, which is currently in the process of being configured, has the capacity to emulate at least five billion neurons. The commercially available systems offered by SpiNNcloud can reach an even higher level of at least 10 billion neurons, says Mr Gonzalez.The future will be one of different types of computing platforms - conventional, neuromorphic and quantum, which is another novel type of computing also on the horizon - all working together, says Prof Kenyon.']"

""People saved money, took time to think about what to do with it, and many of them decided that it was better invested on their roof than in their bank.""Meanwhile, the government introduced ambitious new targets, including covering 81% of Spain’s electricity needs with renewables by 2030.', 'However, behind this success story, there are concerns within the electricity industry caused by an imbalance between supply and demand with, at times, a surplus of electricity.Even though the Spanish economy has bounced back strongly from the trauma of the Covid pandemic, and is growing faster than all of the bloc’s other big economies, electricity consumption has been dropping in recent years.Last year, demand for electricity was even below that seen in the pandemic year 2020, and the lowest since 2003.""What we saw until 2005 was that when GDP increased, demand for electricity increased more than GDP,"" says Miguel de la Torre Rodríguez, head of system development at Red Eléctrica (REE), the company that operates Spain\'s national grid.More recently, he says, ""we\'ve seen that demand has increased less than GDP. What we\'re seeing is a decoupling of energy intensity from the economy"".', 'There are several reasons for the recent drop in demand. They include the energy crisis triggered by Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which caused businesses and homes across Europe to cut back on usage.Also, energy efficiency has improved and become more commonplace.The increased usage of renewable energy has also contributed to the reduction in demand for electricity from the national grid.Mr Rodríguez says that during daylight hours, when solar energy output is particularly strong, the supply-demand balance can be pushed out of kilter, having an impact on prices.""Since the power system always has to have an equilibrium – demand has to equal generation – that has meant there has been excess generation during those hours,"" he says. ""That has driven prices down, especially during certain hours, when the prices have been zero or even negative.""', 'While such low prices are welcome for consumers, they are potentially a problem when it comes to attracting investment to the industry.""This can make it more difficult for investors to increase their investment in new electricity based on renewable energies,"" says Sara Pizzinato, a renewable energy expert at Greenpeace Spain. ""That can be a bottleneck for the energy transition.""Concerns about Spain having an excess of electricity have led to discussion of the need to accelerate the ""electrification"" of the economy, which involves moving it away from fossil fuels. The Sánchez government has set a target of making 34% of the economy reliant on electricity by 2030.""This process is going slowly, and we need to accelerate it,"" says UNEF’s José Donoso. ""Electricity is the cheapest and most competitive way to produce clean energy.""We need facilities that use electricity in place of fossil fuels.""', 'Shifting to a total reliance on electricity is seen as unrealistic, as some important sectors like chemicals and metals will find the transition difficult.However, Mr Donoso and others see plenty of scope for swifter electrification. For example, Spain is trailing many of its European neighbours when it comes to the installation of heat pumps in homes, and the use of electric cars, which only make up around 6% of vehicles on the road.Ms Pizzinato agrees that electrification is crucial, but says there are other ways of tackling the supply-demand quandary, including phasing out the use of nuclear plants more quickly, and increasing energy storage capability.She says: ""We need to engage more people and more industries in demand-side management, to make sure the flexibility needed in the system is out there to make generation and demand match better during the day and during the night.""', ""Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

The battle for Gen Z social shoppers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511p8gdn21o#2,"If TikTok is banned in the US, where might its social shoppers go?","Thu, 13 Jun 2024 23:09:47 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.265962,"['Shopping habits have not been the same since the Covid pandemic and resulting lockdowns.For many, and particularly younger shoppers, it saw the lines blur between social media and e-commerce.Unable to shop in person, and with TikTok downloads soaring, a trend began that would go on to be described as a cultural phenomenon: #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt.The hashtag, where users post what they’ve bought thanks to recommendations about products on the app, has now been posted more than seven billion times.For Lilia Souri and AJ Pulvirenti who co-host the marketing podcast ""Gen Z on Gen Z"" by creative agency Movers+Shakers, TikTok is winning with their generation.""It’s become one of the biggest because of how advanced the algorithm is, and because, before TikTok Shop even was created, we were seeing shopping behaviours happening on TikTok as a whole,” says 27-year-old Lilia Souri.“You can purchase a product directly on the platform, and then continue scrolling, in a cycle of watch, shop, repeat,” her co-host AJ Pulvirenti, 25, adds.Social shopping is a big market and growing fast. In 2023 globally it was worth $570bn (£446bn), and is forecast to be worth more than a trillion dollars by 2028, according to estimates by Statista.Listen: The battle for Gen Z social shoppers', ""While TikTok is one of the big players, its position looks vulnerable. TikTok could be banned in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance.So where would that leave social shopping?If you look at the number of buyers, then Facebook is still the biggest presence in social shopping, according to Jasmine Enberg, chief social media analyst at E Marketer.Most of its transactions take place on Facebook Marketplace, “one of the few places where Gen-Z and young people still go to on Facebook,” she adds.But if you're looking at the percentage of users who actually buy something, then TikTok is ahead, says Ms Enberg.Data from US-based E-marketer suggests 40% of TikTok users in the US will make at least one purchase on the platform this year, in front of both Facebook and Instagram.“It’s a very important activity on the app, especially for its users,” says Ms Enberg.Keen not to be left out, Amazon added a Consult-a-Friend feature last year, allowing customers to ask friends for advice while scrolling through its app.Gen Z podcaster AJ Pulvirenti is sceptical about these new features.“When a platform just tries to replicate something from another platform and doesn't offer anything very new or intriguing about it, it's not going to make people feel inclined to switch from something that they're used to,” he says.A recent study by market-research firm Data.ai suggests that Gen Z spend around two hours a day on TikTok, compared to a little less than 10 minutes on Amazon."", 'Perhaps TikTok\'s experience in Indonesia might have some useful lessons.In 2021 it became the first country to pilot the app\'s e-commerce service, and became one of the biggest markets for TikTok Shop.But with local commerce suffering in the wake of the pandemic, the government introduced rules last October to protect local retailers, which forced TikTok Shop to close. For 26-year-old entrepreneur Evo Syah it was a major blow.“It’s hard for me, but what I can do?” he says recalling the tough decisions he had to make.“I just start my business for one year, and then they shut me down,” he says.But two months after the closure, TikTok agreed to invest $1.5bn in Indonesia’s biggest e-commerce platform Tokopedia, meaning sellers like Evo Syah and millions of others could return to the app.The 26-year-old said he “never felt happier”. But not everything went back to normal.""Before the TikTok shop closed I could get sales like 20 million rupiah (£966) daily. But after it reopened again that’s down to 10 million rupiah (£483),” he says.Mr Syah sells most of his products on livestreams, a selling method which has boomed in popularity in Asia, but according to Ms Enberg has failed to take off in the UK and US.“Indonesia is a very different commerce landscape to the US,” she says.However, in both Indonesia and the US,  TikTok Shop has been crucial for a lot of small and local merchants, she adds.“Many of them don\'t really have another place that is as powerful as TikTok.”', 'Looking ahead to a potential US ban, Ms Enberg says it would send ripples through the world of social shopping. “Instagram Reels is the most natural fit for a lot of displaced TikTok users. But we\'ll probably also see a rise of new apps.""Gen Z podcast hosts AJ Pulvirenti and Lilia Souri agree: “In a world where maybe TikTok is banned. Those behaviours are still going to exist and they\'re still going to thrive,” Lilia says.“In a world where this may happen. I think this next big thing has yet to be created,” adds AJ.']"
'We are creating new crops five-times faster',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9xxjx7e2gjo#2,How artificial intelligence is increasingly helping the arable farming sector.,"Wed, 12 Jun 2024 23:06:31 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.266075,"['Like the bosses of many food companies, Jeremy Bunch is worried about the impact of climate change on his business.“Weather and the climate are maybe the number one risk to our company,” says the boss of US flour firm Shepherd’s Grain.Based in Idaho, the business sources wheat from farmers across the US Pacific northwest.As weather patterns become more unpredictable, Mr Bunch says: “I need to have a plan B, and plan C, in case plan A fails.”To help strengthen these plans, Mr Bunch’s company is now using an AI-powered software system called ClimateAi.Using current and past data, such as from satellite imagery and temperature and rainfall readings, and combining that with future projections, ClimateAi aims to give farmers the most accurate possible, locally-tailored weather forecasts, from one hour to six months ahead.It then advises on exactly when to plant and harvest particular crops, and predicts their yields.', 'Shepherd’s Grain only started using ClimateAi last year, but already most of its 40 plus farmers are now being guided by the app.“They’re beginning to look at ClimateAi to help them plan for crop management decisions in their wheat crops, the primary crop grown in the region,” says Mr Bunch.“A forward look at the weather helps our growers decide which crops to plant. The platform knows when to plant, and when the crop will start flowering and producing seed.”One of the biggest problems facing the seed industry is how to launch climate resilient seeds to market faster and cheaper, says Himanshu Gupta, chief executive of San Francisco-based ClimateAi.“By the time some seed companies do this, in say 10 to 15 years, the climate has already changed,” says Mr Gupta. “We are running against time to launch new seed varieties.”He says that ClimateAi helps these firms to see how specific test seeds have performed in a particular region or locality. “This can help seed companies figure out the optimal locations for growing seeds.”', 'Last year, a study published in scientific journal Nature warned of the potentially dire consequences of numerous crop failures happening at the same time around the world, as a result of the impact of climate change.“Simultaneous harvest failures across major crop-producing regions are a threat to global food security,” said the report, which was led by climate scientist Kai Kornhuber from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.This warning comes as the world population is expected to reach 10 billion people by 2050, up from eight billion currently, according to the United Nations.With increased pressure on crops, at the same time as the global population continues to grow, could AI be key to developing new varieties that can better cope with extremes of weather?', 'In the city of Arusha in Tanzania, David Guerena, agricultural scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, is leading a project called Artemis.Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, this is using AI to help breed more resilient crops. Specifically the AI is helping speed up work called phenotyping.This is the visual studying of new crop varieties based on observations of their characteristics, such as how many flowers, pods or leaves that a plant has.“Traditionally it takes around 10 years to develop a new crop variety,” explains Mr Guerena. “But given the pace of climate change, this timeframe is no longer viable.""He adds that the phenotyping work traditionally relied on the human eye. “But humans are just not doing this consistently, with the high levels of precision necessary, to make subtle, yet important, plant selections,” says Mr Guerena.“It can be over 30˚C in the field. It’s just tiring, and fatigue affects data quality.”Instead, growers involved in the project are taking photos of their crops through an app on a smartphone.  The trained AI can then quickly analyses, records, and reports what it sees.“Computers can count every flower or pod, from every plant, every day without getting tired,” says Mr Guerena. “This is really important as the number of flowers in bean plants correlate to the number of pods which directly influence yields.“Data can be so complicated, to understand what’s happening, but AI can be used to make sense of that complicated data and pick up patterns, show where we need resources, show recommendations.“Our plant breeders estimate that with the better data from the AI computer vision they may be able to shorten the breeding cycle to only a few years.”', 'In North Carolina, Avalo is an agriculture technology or “agri-tech” business also working to create climate-resilient crops. It does this by using AI to help study a crop’s genetics.“Our process starts with genomic data about crops, for example, the sequences of various varieties,” says Rebecca White, Avalo’s chief operating officer.“For example, with different tomatoes, there’s some small differences in genomes that give them different traits, for example different flavours, pesticide-resilient profiles. Our machine-learning programme is able to take these small differences across a number of varieties and see which genomes are important for what traits.”Using their tech they have been able to create a broccoli that matures in a greenhouse in 37 days rather than the standard 45 to 60 days, says Ms White.“Broccoli produced on that timescale can get additional growth cycles, and it saves carbon footprint and improves the environmental impact.”Avalo, which works with companies in Asia and North America, is also working to make rice resistant to frost, and potatoes more tolerant to drought.“Our core technologies can identify the genetic basis of complex traits with minimal training and, via sequencing and predictive analysis, quickly and inexpensively assess and model new plant varieties,” says Ms White.“We are creating new varieties for diverse crops that are developed five-times faster and for a fraction of the cost compared to traditional breeding.”', 'However, while AI can help mitigate the impact of climate-related weather, and enhance crop resilience, there are a number of challenges when it comes to using AI in agriculture, says Kate E Jones, professor of ecology and biodiversity at University College London.“The effectiveness of AI in ensuring food security also depends on addressing challenges such as data quality, technology accessibility… while acknowledging that AI is one tool among many in a comprehensive strategy for sustainable and resilient agriculture.”']"
'Insane' amounts of data spurs new storage tech,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd116m3jyn1o#2,Storing information with holograms and in glass is being proposed to deal with a deluge of data.,"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 23:03:29 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:16.266188,"['The year 2039 might seem like a long way off, but Ian Crawford is already planning for it.It will mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War Two - a big year for his employer, the Imperial War Museum. Mr Crawford is chief information officer at the museum, and oversees a project to digitise its huge collection of pictures, audio and film.With a collection of around 24,000 hours of film and video, and 11 million photographs, it\'s a vast task. And in the run-up to 2039, World War II material will be a priority.Making digital copies of those historical sources is vital as the original copies degrade over time, and will, one day, be lost forever. ""When you\'ve got the only copy, you want confidence that your storage system is reliable,"" says Ian Crawford.The amount of data needed for such long-term storage is growing all the time, as the latest scanners can record documents and films in great detail.""It\'s potential to grow is enormous really,"" says Mr Crawford.""We\'re now looking at objects themselves and scanning in 3D - that can generate very large files.""', 'This deluge of data is not just hitting museums - it\'s pouring down everywhere.Businesses are buying more space for back-up data, hospitals need somewhere to store records, government needs a place to stash increasing amounts of information.""We are continuing to create insane amounts of data,"" says Simon Robinson, principal analyst at research firm Enterprise Strategy Group.""For most organisations - it varies a lot - their data volume is doubling every four to five years. And in some industries it is growing much faster than that,"" he says. Data that needs to be held for a long time is not stored in traditional data centres, those vast warehouses, with racks of servers and blinking lights. Those operations are designed for data that needs to be accessed and updated frequently.Instead, the most popular way to keep data for the long-term is on tape. In particular a format known as  LTO (Linear Tape Open), the latest version being called LTO-9.The tapes themselves are not unlike old VHS tapes, but a bit smaller and more square. Inside the cassette is a kilometre of magnetic tape, capable of storing 18 terabytes of data. That\'s a lot - just one tape can hold the same amount of data as almost 300 standard smartphones.The Imperial War Museum in Duxford uses a tape system from Spectra Logic. The machine, around the size of a large wardrobe, can hold up to 1,500 LTO tapes.Such LTO systems dominate the market for long-term storage. They have been around for decades, and have proved themselves to be reliable.It\'s also pretty cheap, which is important as generally customers want to pay as little as possible for long-term storage.', 'Nevertheless some are convinced it can be done better.In a former wallpaper factory in Chiswick, west London, a start-up firm has been developing a long-term storage system that uses lasers to burn tiny holograms into a light-sensitive polymer.Chief executive Charlie Gale points out that with magnetic tape, data can only be stored on the surface, whereas holograms can store data in multiple layers.""You can do things called multiplexing, whereby you can layer multiple sets of information in one space. That\'s really kind of the superpower of what we\'re doing. And we believe we can put more information in less space than ever before,"" he says.HoloMem\'s polymer blocks can handle extreme temperatures, without the data becoming corrupted - between -14C to 160C.', ""By comparison, magnetic tape needs to be kept between 16C and 25C, which means significant heating and cooling costs, particularly in countries with extreme temperatures.Tape also needs replacing after around 15 years, whereas the polymer is good for at least 50 years.Mr Gale notes that, as the laser chemically changes the polymer, the data can't be tampered with, once it has been written.Holomem's prototype system, which will be able to store and retrieve data, will be ready later this year.Mr Gale says the cost of the system has been kept down by using standard, widely available components, including the laser - so, he's confident that HoloMem will be able to match, or beat the costs of magnetic tape."", 'HoloMem will need to be competitive, as looming over the market is a formidable competitor.Through its research arm, Microsoft is developing its own long-term data storage system.Like HoloMem it has decided that it\'s time to move on from magnetic tape, but Microsoft has chosen glass as it storage material.Called Project Silica, the system uses powerful lasers to create tiny structural changes in the glass, called voxels that can be used to store data. The voxels are incredibly small and can be packed into layers.Microsoft says that a 2mm thick piece of glass about the size of a DVD would be able to store more than seven terabytes of data.The system stores the glass panes on racks, where they can be accessed by small crab-like robots that zip along rails.Cheap and durable, glass is an attractive storage medium says Richard Black, who heads up Project Silica.""It\'s pretty much immune to temperature, humidity, particulates, electromagnetic fields,"" says Mr Black.It could potentially preserve data for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years.Such a system could, one day, be integrated into Microsoft\'s huge cloud computing business, Azure.But that is some way off as the system has years of development ahead of it.', 'Back in Duxford, the Imperial War Museum, like many organisations, has been experimenting with artificial intelligence. They recently tested whether AI could identify different models of Spitfire in pictures from its image catalogue.Mr Crawford thinks that AI could be incredibly useful in cataloguing its digital library, work that would take humans hundreds of years. The ability of AI to trawl through vast amounts of data has made keeping that data even more important - there could be something valuable lurking there.""In the past business was archiving data just in case they needed it.

At the heart of his plan to boost the country\'s economic growth are changes to the planning system, aimed at making it easier to build houses and infrastructure.Proposals to give local leaders more powers, bring the railways into public ownership and increase workers\' rights were also included.Some proposed pieces of legislation, first introduced by the last government, have been revived including Rishi Sunak\'s gradual smoking ban and the introduction of a football regulator.However, there were some notable omissions, with no mention of scrapping the two-child benefit cap - which some Labour MPs and the SNP have been pushing for. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader and now independent MP for Islington North, joined the calls to ""do it now"" and suggested the announcement of a child poverty taskforce was a way to ""just delay it"".He said: ""Why not do it now and just say quite simply, \'we\'re going to end the cap\'? ""It\'s simply cruel and nasty to say that the third, fourth or fifth child of a family is less valuable than the first two.""A bill implementing Labour\'s manifesto promise to give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote in general elections was also missing but ministers say this will be introduced at a later stage. Green Party MP Sian Berry said she was disappointed as ""young people need a real voice"", adding she believed they would help strengthen the calls to remove the two-child cap.Labour backbencher Rebecca Long Bailey, a former shadow cabinet member, also called on her party to urgently ""settle the debt of honour we owe"" to women born in the 1950s who suffered ""pension injustice"", known as the Waspi women.The speech was delivered by King Charles - accompanied by the traditional pageantry - but was written by the new Labour government, elected on 4 July with a big majority of 174.Following the King’s Speech, Conservative leader Mr Sunak said his party would not oppose the government “for the sake of it” but would hold it to account on its election promises.On Labour’s proposed changes to planning rules, he said everyone wanted to see the process speeded up but warned that “a system that does not allow local people to have a say will damage public consent for more housing in the long term”.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper welcomed a promise to reform the Mental Health Act but said she wanted to see more ambition on health and social care.

In the government\'s briefing notes, it argued that one of the ""major brakes"" on economic growth has been the current planning regime and used the King\'s Speech to introduce its Planning and Infrastructure Bill.The bill, which will apply to England, Wales and, in parts, to Scotland aims to accelerate the building of homes and infrastructure.Under the government\'s plans, the capacity of local planning departments will be boosted and the process for getting consent to infrastructure projects such as solar farms or grid connections simplified. The government says in future local communities will only be to able influence how, not if, new houses are built.Given Labour\'s hefty majority in the House of Commons, the planning bill is likely to get through Parliament.However, new developments could face vigorous opposition from the local communities affected by building projects.', ""Other measures the government hopes will bolster economic growth include its English Devolution Bill.The bill would give local leaders more powers over transport, skills and employment and make it easier to request further powers. The Better Buses Bill would allow local politicians to create publicly-owned bus operators. One bill would set up a National Wealth Fund to boost investment in infrastructure and green industry. Another will establish Great British Energy, a state-owned company to invest in renewable energy.When Mr Sunak called the general election in May, several government bills progressing through Parliament had to be ditched. The Labour government has now said it will reintroduce some of those pieces of legislation including the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which bans people born on or after 1 January 2009 from being able to buy cigarettes. The Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Bill would establish Martyn's Law, requiring premises to mitigate the impact of a potential terrorist attack. The measure has been campaigned for by Figen Murray, the mother of Martyn Hett, one of the 22 people killed in the 2017 terrorist attack on Manchester Arena. Downing Street says at least six of the bills outlined in the King's Speech will be introduced to Parliament this week. "", 'Responding to the speech, Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice said the government\'s policies would lead to higher taxes and more regulation. Green Party MP Ellie Chowns said she wanted to see ""bolder action"" on improving building standards and introducing rent controls. The SNP\'s Stephen Gethins said the ""biggest thing pulling back growth"" was Brexit and criticised the government for not using its big majority to reverse the ""hard Tory Brexit"". He also criticised the government for not removing the two-child benefit limit.The cap prevents households on universal credit or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. During the debate following the King\'s speech, former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said ditching the limit would lift 300,000 children out of poverty. Sir Keir has previously said he understood the objections to the cap but that removing it was currently unaffordable.After the King\'s Speech, the government announced a taskforce to deliver a child poverty strategy, to be led by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson.', 'Among other measures, the King\'s Speech also included:the Renters\' Rights Bill banning so-called no fault evictions and extending safety rules to private tenantsthe Water (Special Measures) Bill making the bosses of private water companies personally liable for lawbreakingthe Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill allowing police to use counter-terror powers to tackle gangs smuggling migrants into the UKthe draft Conversion Practices Bill introducing new restrictions on ""abusive"" practices intended to change people\'s sexual orientation or gender identitythe House of Lords (Hereditary Peers) Bill removing hereditary peers from the upper chamber.']"

Why the devil is in the 'devolution desert' detail,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0351175g87o#1,Deputy PM Angela Rayner wants to give more powers to local areas but delivery could be tricky.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 16:07:03 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.796021,"['The way local government works might not sound like the most exciting thing on the government’s long to-do list, but Keir Starmer has decided it matters.Why? Because the prime minister has made economic growth a priority, and it’s the government’s view that local leaders across England have a vital role to play in helping to achieve that.So what’s the plan, and crucially: can it work?At the moment devolution - the powers that have been handed down from Westminster to local authorities across England - is patchy.Some areas, like Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, have elected mayors with control over things like housing, skills and transport which is meant to help them boost local growth.Other areas are working on deals that would see powers handed down to groups of councils working together.But the powers - and the funding - that have been handed down vary widely from place to place, and there are some parts of England that aren’t covered at all.', 'The Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, has written to councils in these areas that are described as “devolution deserts” inviting them to work with the government on plans to give them more power in their local areas.The claim is that those with “skin in the game” can make better decisions over what’s needed in their area.The idea is broadly welcome across the local government sector, but the devil will be in the detail and it won’t be without difficulty.The last Conservative government embarked on a programme of devolution, but it often ran into long and complex negotiations over geography or governance - exactly which bodies in which areas should have power and how they should be accountable to the public.The Labour government has made clear it likes the idea of elected mayors; Keir Starmer even invited the existing mayors to Downing Street in his first week in office.But not every area thinks a mayor is the right solution. In Bristol residents voted to scrap the idea of an elected mayor during a referendum in 2022.', ""The County Councils Network, which represents some of England’s largest local authorities often in rural areas, welcomes the government’s approach to devolution.However, it says that while “there are benefits to mayors or directly-elected leaders, the reality is they are unsuitable for some county areas” - adding that not having one should not inhibit a region’s ambition.In her letter to councils, Angela Rayner has made clear the government sees the advantages of metro mayors but won’t “force” them on any local area, instead inviting regions to come up with devolution proposals by the end of September.The government is clearly pitching partnership to a sector that has often felt overlooked, but delivering devolution hasn’t always been simple.And there’s another issue too.The financial strain facing local authorities is well-documented, with huge pressure on budgets for social care, children's services and housing in particular.Ms Rayner, who is also the housing, communities and local government secretary, says in her letter that the cabinet understands the pressure many councils are under and will ensure they “have the resources to deliver new devolved powers and functions.”Again, the devil will be in the detail.The government’s argument is that boosting economic growth will allow investment in public services, and clearly ministers believe giving more power to local leaders to make decisions for their area is a key part of that.But finding a way to make it work in practice for a sector that’s already under strain is what will count.""]"

She added that she ""looked forward"" to meeting him and Donald Trump if they won the US election in November.', 'His comments on the UK becoming an “Islamist country” were a direct criticism of Labour’s approach to immigration, and he also said that the Tories “have got to get a handle on this”. Right-wing US political figures have often linked immigration to a rise in Islamism in a country and have regularly focused on the UK.During his speech to the National Conservatism conference Mr Vance made several further comments attacking immigration.He declared: ""The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more.""In the speech Mr Vance also said “I was in London last year, and it’s not doing so good” referring to both high house prices and high immigration, making a link between those.Speaking on ITV, Ms Rayner said: ""I\'m very proud of the election success that Labour had recently.""We won votes across all different communities, across the whole of the country, and we\'re interested in governing on behalf of Britain and also working with our international allies.""Mr Vance\'s comments were also criticised by Exchequer Secretary James Murray.Mr Murray told Sky News: ""I don\'t know what he was driving at in that comment, to be honest. I mean, in Britain, we\'re very proud of our diversity.""I\'m very proud that we have a new government, I\'m very proud that our Labour government is committed to national security and economic growth. I\'m very clear where we are. ""I don\'t really know how that comment fits in.""Foreign Secretary David Lammy has spent recent months consciously seeking to forge strong relations with Donald Trump’s allies, among them Mr Vance.Mr Lammy met Mr Vance alongside several Trump allies during a goodwill mission to the US in May, describing him as his ""friend"".In a speech at the right-leaning Hudson Institute in Washington in May, Mr Lammy said Mr Vance was ""right to say we in Europe have a problem that we need to fix with higher defence expenditure"".He also said Trump has been “often misunderstood” when it comes to Nato, that he “gets the agenda that drives America First”, and that he would find “common cause” with a Trump administration.But Mr Vance\'s selection could pose a challenge for the new Labour government if Trump returns to the White House.Former US President Trump has opted for one of the most isolationist members of the Republican Party. The former Trump-critic, now Trump-evangelist, opposes aiding Ukraine - while Sir Keir Starmer has committed to spending £3bn on aid for Ukraine for ""as long as it takes"".On Tuesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson met Trump on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.""We discussed Ukraine and I have no doubt that he will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy,"" Mr Johnson posted on X. ', 'Mr Vance has also criticised Europe\'s overdependence on the US in foreign policy - potentially straining US-UK relations. Regardless of Mr Vance’s recent intervention, Labour believes their diplomacy with Trump’s team is beginning to bear fruit. Labour sources point to Sir Keir\'s conversation with the ex-president on Sunday in the aftermath of the assassination attempt - the first time the pair had spoken.Andrew Bowie, the shadow veterans minister, said he ""absolutely"" disagreed with the claim that Labour was creating an ""Islamist country"".He told Times Radio: ""I disagree with the Labour Party fundamentally on many issues, but I do not agree with that view, quite frankly.

Shoplifting crackdown expected to be unveiled,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngk8yp3v4o#1,"Measures to target ""low-value"" shoplifting and the abuse of shop workers are due to be announced in the King's Speech.","Tue, 16 Jul 2024 16:28:59 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.796413,"['A crackdown on shoplifting is expected to be announced in the King\'s Speech on Wednesday.The government is due to unveil a new crime bill to target people who steal goods worth less than £200.The policy would be a reversal of 2014 legislation that meant ""low-value"" thefts worth under £200 were subject to less serious punishment.The government is also expected to introduce a specific offence of assaulting a shop worker to its legislative agenda.It will not be clear until legislation passes through Parliament what the punishments for any new or strengthened offences would be. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that last year was the worst on record for shoplifting in England and Wales. Police recorded over 430,000 offences in those nations in 2023 - though retailers say underreporting means these figures are likely to represent only a fraction of the true number of incidents.', 'Michelle Whitehead, who works at a convenience store in Wolverhampton, said her shop had been ""hit every day"" by thieves.People were stealing ""absolutely anything"" including ""tins of spam, tins of corned beef, all the fresh meat"", Ms Whitehead told BBC Radio 4\'s World at One programme. ""They’re just coming in, getting their whole arm and sweeping the lot off the shelves,"" she said. ""The shelves were always empty.""She said she believed ""organised"" criminal gangs, rather than individuals struggling with the cost of living, were behind the thefts in her shop.The crackdown on ""low-value"" shoplifting ""will help a lot of little shops,"" Ms Whitehead said. While retailers and shop workers have welcomed the anticipated proposals, a civil liberties group has raised concerns about criminalising people struggling to make ends meet and overburdening the prison system. The new legal measures are expected to be announced as part of the King\'s Speech on Wednesday, a key piece of the State Opening of Parliament that allows the government to outline its priorities over the coming months. Before the general election, the Labour Party pledged to reverse what it described as the ""shoplifter\'s charter"" - a piece of 2014 legislation that reduced the criminal punishment for ""low-value shoplifting"".Tom Holder, spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium (BRC), told BBC News the impact of the 2014 legislation has been to ""deprioritise it in the eyes of police"". ""I think police would be less likely to turn up to what they see as low-level theft,"" he said.  Shoplifting cost retailers £1.8 billion in the last year, which could impact prices, according to the BRC. ""Shoplifting harms everyone in that sense - those costs eventually get made up somewhere, whether it\'s prices going up or other prices that can\'t come down,"" Mr Holder said. Co-op campaigns and public affairs director Paul Gerrard said the supermarket chain had also recorded rising theft and violence against shop workers.""There’s always been people who will steal to make ends meet. That’s not what is behind the rise we’ve seen,"" he told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme on Tuesday. ""What’s behind that rise is individuals and gangs targeting large volumes of stock in stores for resale in illicit venues like pubs, clubs, markets, and out the back of cars.""But Jodie Beck, policy and campaigns officer at civil liberties organisation Liberty, had concerns about the expected proposals, saying there is ""already a wide range of powers"" the police can use to tackle shoplifting and anti-social behaviour levelled at retail staff.Ms Beck said the ""£200 threshold"" would not just target criminal gangs but also ""people who are pushed into the desperate situation of not paying for things"" because they cannot afford to make ends meet.She urged the government to avoid focusing on ""criminal justice and policing solutions instead of doing the thoughtful work of looking at the root causes of crime, which we believe are related to poverty and inequality"".Ms Beck also argued the additional legislation could serve to worsen the UK\'s ""enormous court backlog"" and its ""bursting prison system"".Last week, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced plans to release thousands of prisoners early to ease overcrowding in the country\'s prisons.A spokesperson for Downing Street said the government would not comment on the King\'s Speech until it has been delivered by the monarch.A National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesperson said the organisation had worked with the government last year to develop the Retail Crime Action Plan, to reduce commercial theft.The plan involves treating shoplifting as organised crime. ""Police forces have embedded the plan in their operational work and we’re already seeing positive results,"" they added.']"

Recruitment is failing to match retention, with many soldiers and officers complaining about neglected and substandard accommodation.The Royal Navy, which has spent vast sums on its two centrepiece aircraft carriers, is in need of many more surface ships to fulfil its tasks around the globe.Its ageing fleet of nuclear-armed Vanguard submarines, the cornerstone of the UK’s strategic defence and known as the Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), is overdue for replacement by four Dreadnought class submarines and costs are mounting.Commenting on the review, Mr Healey said: “Hollowed-out armed forces, procurement waste and neglected morale cannot continue.”', 'The defence and security threats facing the UK, Nato and its allies further afield are multiple.They include a war raging on Europe’s eastern flank in Ukraine against Russia’s full-scale invasion. The UK, along with the EU and Nato, has opted to help defend Ukraine with multi-billion pound packages of weapons and aid, stopping short of committing combat troops.The policy behind this is not entirely altruistic. European governments, especially those closest to Russia like Poland and the Baltic states, fear that if President Putin wins the war in Ukraine it will not be long before he rebuilds his army and invades them next.Some of those countries are already busy beefing up their own defence spending closer to 3% or even 4% of GDP.The challenge for Nato has been how to provide Ukraine with as much weaponry as it can, without provoking Russia into retaliating against a Nato state and risk triggering a third world war.The Royal Navy has been in action recently in the Red Sea, where it has been operating alongside the US Navy in fending off attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.But the UK has also made naval commitments further afield in the South China Sea with the Aukus pact, comprising of Australia, UK and the US, aimed at containing Chinese expansion in the region.Critics have questioned whether a financially-constrained UK can afford to make commitments like this on the other side of the world.Closer to home in Europe, there is a growing threat from so-called “hybrid warfare” attacks, suspected of coming from Russia.These are anonymous, unattributable attacks on undersea pipelines and telecoms cables on which Western nations depend.As tensions increase with Moscow there are fears such actions will only increase and the UK cannot possibly hope to guard all of its coastline all of the time.', 'But while those nervous Nato partners living close to Russia’s borders are busy beefing up their defence spending closer to 3 or even 4% of GDP, the UK has so far declined to put a timetable on when it will raise its own defence spending to just 2.5%.Opposition figures have criticised the government for refusing to say when defence spending will be increased.Before his election defeat, former prime minister Rishi Sunak committed to reaching 2.5% by 2030.Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge previously said: ""In a world that is more volatile and dangerous than at any time since the Cold War, Keir Starmer’s Labour government had a clear choice to match the Conservatives’ fully funded pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030.""By failing to do so, they’ve created huge uncertainty for our armed forces, at the worst possible time.”']"

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the programme, which is expected to focus on economic growth, will show urgency and that “there is no time to waste”.Sir Keir has said the government “is serious about delivering the stability that is going to turbo charge growth”.But as well as economic measures, it is a chance for the new government to set out its key priorities in other areas.The programme is also expected to bring back legislation to introduce Martyn\'s Law, named after Manchester Bombing victim Martyn Hett.The proposed law, which had been promised by Rishi Sunak, would require venues and local authorities to have preventative plans to deal with terror attacks.Plans were introduced in the last Parliament but did not pass before it was wound up before the election, which prompted Martyn\'s mother, Figen Murray, to say she felt ""let down"" by Mr Sunak.The spiking law will apply in England and Wales. Any further measures in Scotland and Wales will be for devolved politicians.']"

Starmer commits to BBC licence fee,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c047pmx47rno#1,The prime minister has ruled out any changes to how the BBC is funded at least until 2027.,"Sat, 13 Jul 2024 09:10:17 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.799025,"['Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out changes to how the BBC is funded until at least 2027. “We are committed in our manifesto to the BBC and to the licensing scheme,” the prime minister said during his trip to Washington DC this week.The BBC has faced real terms cuts in recent years, including a two-year freeze on the licence fee, leading to cuts to services and programmes.The Conservative government suggested in 2022 it would abolish the licence fee when its charter was up for renewal and move towards a voluntary funding model. But signalling his commitment to the existing model, Sir Keir said: “There’s going to be some more thought between now and [2027], but we are committed to the BBC and we are committed to the licensing arrangements.""Among programmes impacted by recent cuts was BBC Two\'s Newsnight, which was stripped back as part of efforts to find £500m in savings.The licence fee was frozen at £159 for two years by Nadine Dorries when she was culture secretary in Boris Johnson’s government.The Conservative government and the BBC agreed a six-year deal which included the two-year freeze, with annual increases set to follow inflation from 2024 until March 2028.But the Conservatives in December decided against that deal, announcing a below-inflation rise of £10.50 per year to £169.50 coming in from 1 April.The BBC’s director general Tim Davie announced back in March that the corporation would explore how to reform the licence fee.The licence fee pays for BBC services including TV, radio, the BBC website, podcasts, iPlayer and apps.Its existence is guaranteed until at least 31 December 2027 by the BBC\'s royal charter, which sets out its funding and purpose.A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We remain totally focused on offering value to the public and will engage with the government on funding at the appropriate time.”']"

Thousands of prisoners to be released in September,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg5vp0296eo#1," Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood warns of a ""total breakdown of law and order"" unless action is taken.","Fri, 12 Jul 2024 18:47:31 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.799431,"['Thousands of prisoners will be released early at the start of September, the justice secretary has announced.Shabana Mahmood warned of the ""total collapse"" of the prison system and a ""total breakdown of law and order"" without urgent action to ease prison overcrowding.She accused Rishi Sunak and the previous Conservative government of a ""disgraceful dereliction of duty"" for not dealing with the crisis when they were in power. Under her plan, some prisoners will be released after they have served 40% of their sentence in England and Wales, rather than the current 50%. Ms Mahmood said she expected the first batch of prisoners released in September to be ""in the low thousands"", with further releases over the next 18 months and updates made to Parliament every three months. Over the next 18 months, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) told BBC Verify it estimated up to 4,000 extra male prisoners and fewer than 1,000 female prisoners will be released under the new measures. Sentences for serious violent offences of four years or more and sex offences will be automatically excluded from the change, as will the early release of offenders in prison for domestic abuse connected crimes, including stalking and choking. Speaking at HMP Five Wells in Northamptonshire, Ms Mahmood said jails had been operating at 99% capacity since the start of last year and were now weeks away from running out of space.If that happened overflow police cells would be filled, she warned, leading to ""van-loads of dangerous people circling the country with nowhere to go"".She added: ""Soon, the courts would grind to a halt, unable to hold trials.“With officers unable to act, criminals could do whatever they want, without consequence. ""We could see looters running amok, smashing in windows, robbing shops and setting neighbourhoods alight.""In short, if we fail to act now, we face the collapse of the criminal justice system. And a total breakdown of law and order.""', 'As Ms Mahmood painted a bleak picture she would have been aware that allowing some prisoners out early will not be popular with some people.But she stressed that she had been “left with no choice at all” blaming the previous Conservative government for the crisis. Ms Mahmood knows that the questions and criticism will quickly come her way if this scheme does not work or leads to a rise in offences.Conservative shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat said in a social media post: ""In what world is releasing 20,000 criminals onto our streets a good idea.""However, early release is not new, and the previous justice secretary Alex Chalk announced plans for some prisoners to be released up to two months early back in March under the Conservative government.Mr Chalk, who lost his seat at the general election, told the Today podcast there had also been plans to go further and release some prisoners after 40% of their sentence – as has been announced on Friday – and to send fewer people to jail in the first place. BBC News understands that several Conservative cabinet ministers supported the idea, but Rishi Sunak refused to sign it off and the election was called before the issue was resolved.The Ministry of Justice\'s (MoJ) weekly statistics suggest there are currently 1,451 prison cell spaces left across England and Wales, and an increase of 1,161 inmates over the past 12 months.Mark Icke, Vice-president of the Prison Governors Association (PGA), welcomed the announcement, saying the crisis is “unprecedented” and prison governors have been “warning for some time” that “we’ve got far too many prisoners in our system”.', 'Ex-Labour MP Harriet Harman believes that too many women are being locked up and says the criminal justice system should deal with them in a different way. ""Most women are in prison for very short sentences for non-violent crimes, [and] most themselves have been victims of violence as well,"" she told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme.""There is a very, very different pattern of men and women\'s offending"", Ms Harman said, giving the example of women in for drug offences being less likely to be gang leaders than men, and instead often being victims themselves.She added that 40% of women in UK jails are foreign nationals who should be serving sentences in their home countries. Conservative MP Greg Smith said the Ministry of Justice should focus on building more prisons to ease the pressure on prison places.He also argued it was ""a bit rich"" for Labour to claim they did not want to let prisoners out early.He told the BBC: ""I don\'t think Labour can pretend that this is anything other than something they would naturally do.""The chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor said ""this measure will inevitably lead to the early release of some risky offenders"" but a decision on how to tackle the issue ""needed to be taken and none would have been without risk"". Mr Taylor added the move would add to the workload of already stretched prison OMUs [Offender Management Units] and probation services"" so prison inspectors ""will be watching very closely"" for its impact.However, the aunt of murdered law graduate Zara Aleena has branded the plans a “dangerous gamble with the public safety”.Ms Aleena was murdered by Jordan McSweeney nine days after he was released from prison and while he was in the process of being recalled after his licence was revoked for failing to meet probation officers.Her aunt Farah Naz told BBC Breakfast that underfunding in the probation service, which monitors prisoners when they are released from prison midway through their sentence on licence, means offenders like McSweeney are not being properly supervised in the community.The Ministry of Justice is already building six new prisons to create an extra 20,000 places as demand grows for cell spaces, partially because of the Government\'s campaign to hire 20,000 more police officers.About 6,000 spaces have been created and about 10,000 will be built by the end of 2025.']"

While there is no specific offence of assisted suicide in Scotland, euthanasia is illegal and can be prosecuted as murder or culpable homicide.Trying to kill yourself is not by itself a criminal act.A bill to legalise assisted dying in the UK was defeated in 2015, but was backed by Sir Keir and several Tory cabinet members.He has previously said he thinks ""there are grounds for changing the law"".Opponents to changing the law say it is to protect the vulnerable and ensure that nobody is pressured into dying sooner than they might otherwise.Over 200,000 people signed a petition for a vote on assisted dying, leading to a debate in Parliament in April.There was no vote and the government remains neutral on the issue.Many shared stories related to losing relatives and loved ones, and how it informed their view on the topic of assisted dying.A private member\'s bill (PMB) is a proposed law change introduced by an MP, not the government.PMBs rarely become law without the support of government, as they do not get the same amount of time dedicated to government businesses.Free votes are common on matters to do with health, religion or military intervention.']"

""We were reduced to three [MPs] in 2019 - and that\'s how low our working class vote had become,"" he said.""We won a whole clutch of those seats back the other night, so I think working class communities have found a Labour Party they can vote for this time in a way that wasn\'t the case in recent elections.""He acknowledged there would be challenges in ""how to take this new opponent on"" but said Reform\'s biggest weaknesses were it\'s ""disparaging"" of the NHS and ""apologism for Putin"".Looking around the cabinet table on Saturday morning, the day after the landslide election victory, Mr McFadden said he had been ""struck"" by the fact that ""around that table are more people from ordinary backgrounds than has ever been in a Cabinet in British history"".

June was the quiet month then. Just the small matter of a general election campaign.And here we are in July, and Mr Gething is resigning.So will begin another leadership race, a new government in Wales, a new first minister and a new team of senior Welsh ministers.There will also be more arguments about Welsh Labour – its direction, its priorities, its capacity to govern effectively and its relationship with the UK party.If you’re watching this in Downing Street, it’s the last thing you need.']"

The new government has promised big steps - doubling onshore and quadrupling offshore turbines by 2030. By removing the ban on onshore wind in England just a few days into power, Labour wants to show this is a key priority.The announcement was welcomed by the industry, with reports of big developers such as Germany’s RWE and France’s EDF wanting to move ahead with new onshore projects. Overcoming local objections about the visual impact of land-based turbines will be vital. Community energy activists say public attitudes are changing, and the potential to offer discounts to local consumers is softening opposition.Offshore, Labour's plans face huge hurdles, with global shortages of materials and skills. The big change that’s needed will be making offshore investments more financially attractive.Last year, there were no takers at a government auction for new contracts to develop offshore wind, with firms saying the price set was far too low.

The summit allowed him to demonstrate his government’s support for Ukraine, confirming the UK would continue to provide £3bn in military aid each year.Sir Keir announced a strategic defence review would begin next week and said his commitment to spending 2.5% of national income on defence was “iron clad”. But he faced criticism for refusing to say when or how that target would be met.The challenge for the prime minister and other Nato allies will be how to remain united in their support for Ukraine, as not all are equally resolute. They must also plan for the possibility of a Trump presidency that could see a significant reduction in US military backing for Kyiv.', 'The number of people who are economically inactive due to ill health has risen by 700,000 since the pandemic, to 2.8 million. The government’s big idea to tackle rising levels of worklessness is to create a new national jobs and career service.  It would be based in job centres, but with local areas able to tailor the scheme depending on their own employment needs.Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has praised initiatives in Manchester, where the Greater Manchester Combined Authority has invested money in programmes such as Working Well. This helps people with health conditions and disabilities get “the right job, at the right time.”Who are the millions of people not working?The biggest challenge will be changing perceptions of job centres. For many, they aren’t places to find work and instead mean fearful encounters with officials focussed on ensuring claimants comply with benefit rules.  “Take a job - any job - or you’ll lose your benefits,” has been the message the unemployed have often left with.  If that image doesn’t change, the government’s plan could well be stymied.', 'Labour’s manifesto promised to scrap plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda and set up a new Border Security Command (BSC) to tackle the people smuggling gangs moving tens of thousands of people across the English Channel in inflatable boats.After taking up office, the prime minister swiftly confirmed the end of the Rwanda plan, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said there would be “rapid recruitment of an exceptional leader"" for the BSC.Labour said the new BSC would be partly funded by diverting £75m from the Rwanda policy, set up by the Conservatives in 2022. By the end of 2023, £240m had  been paid to Rwanda. However, Rwanda has said it will not be giving any money back.The one diplomatic mistake of Labour’s first week was its failure to inform the Rwandan government before announcing the end of the joint migration policy, which angered Kigali. Labour also promised to end the ""perma-backlog"" of asylum seekers whose claims are not being processed because of the Illegal Migration Act, which says people who arrive illegally cannot claim asylum. However, the new government has not said how it plans to deal with the estimated 100,000 people caught in this legal limbo.', 'Labour\'s so called ""crackdown"" on water companies includes ring-fencing money for infrastructure investment so it doesn\'t leak out into bonuses, dividends or pay increases. New customer panels will be able to summon water executives to answer for their performance. Compensation payments to households and businesses whose basic services are not up to standard will more than double.But water firms have said a proposed average 21% hike in bills in England and Wales by 2030 won\'t be enough to address problems including sewage leaks. It is a third less than the amount they requested. They are now in a stand-off with regulator Ofwat over how much prices can rise.What the government wants to avoid is having to nationalise a company like Thames Water, which is drowning in £18bn of debt and says it only has enough cash to last 11 months. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has warned nationalising water companies is not something it wants to do. He says it would “cost money we do not have” and slow down the process of reducing pollution levels.Labour is talking tough, but solving the stand-off between the firms and the regulator is one of the big issues it now has to resolve.', 'Jails in England and Wales are on the cusp of reaching full capacity and prison staff say they’re under immense pressure to find spaces that don’t necessarily exist.The Labour government wants to continue building new prison places announced by the Conservatives, but has not said when they will be completed.The government argues that it has had no choice but to announce it will release some prisoners early to free up urgently needed space. But releasing inmates comes with risk. The new government could be seen as soft on crime among those who support longer and tougher sentences. And what if one of those let out early goes on to commit another more serious offence? Ministers are going to have to be very careful who they release, with sources saying we could be looking at thousands let out in the autumn. Serious offenders such as rapists and murderers are exempt from the plans.']"
"Pomp, plans and power – what to expect in Labour’s King’s Speech",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckkgl37lp7no#2,"As the reality of power sets in for Labour ministers, expect few fireworks but plenty of big plans when Parliament is opened.","Sat, 13 Jul 2024 11:47:13 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.800600,"['“Oh god! We’ve got a Labour government!” A delighted member of the Cabinet told me reality only finally hit them when driving through their constituency on Friday, more than a week after voters sent the Tories packing.In the prime minister’s first seven days he’s been confronted with a deeply awkward situation abroad – President Joe Biden’s competence dominating the NATO summit. At home the justice secretary has felt compelled to plan early prisoner releases (it’s unusual a politician would make a willing choice to do that), and doubts over the survival of the steel plant in Port Talbot linger.In other words, Labour is already grappling with the tasks government requires them to do – not the options they would choose.But on Wednesday their own plans will take centre stage, with all the fuss and fanfare Westminster can summon – the attendance of the King, the giant golden throne (yes, really!), the trumpets, the frills and flounces.The first ‘King’s Speech’ will list the law the government hopes to pass in its first year of what Labour already hopes will be a decade in charge.', 'Do not expect Labour’s plans to include fireworks – no rabbits out of fancy hats. Another Cabinet minister said: ""‘We are still in the mode of no surprises, to do the job we are hired to do.”The speech, however, will be absolutely stuffed with plans. Ministers have vied with each other to get their proposals in. The message, I’m told, has been to do the work, get your stuff ready, and the sooner you can do that, the more likely you are to get a slot for it.The speech will be “rooted in Keir’s missions”, another source said – those “six first steps” that we heard about so much in the election. In case you can’t quite remember what they all were (like the now Health Secretary, Wes Streeting), you can refresh your memory here.', 'Wednesday is the start of a drawn-out process of passing at least 30 bills. It will include a couple of dozen new laws, and completing some unfinished business from the old government, as Labour starts to translate its manifesto into new life.Top of the list is getting the economy growing - No 10 and 11’s priority. So expect plans to shake up the planning system, encourage house building, and more powers for the government’s budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.Look out for plans to create Great British Energy, the government’s energy company, to expand workers’ rights, to create the National Wealth Fund - using the power of the public purse for long term investment - and to grant new powers to authorities round the country away from Westminster in the Take Back Control bill (get it?).', 'There are likely to be two new bills from the Home Office - a border security bill so people smugglers can be treated like terrorists and a crime bill to tackle antisocial behaviour and county lines drug trafficking.Plans to reform the Mental Health Act have been promised. Moving the rail industry into public ownership, votes for 16-year-olds and changes to the House of Lords have also been mooted.Rishi Sunak’s smoking ban is expected to be followed through, along with the former government’s vow to end no fault evictions, and to bring in ‘Martyn’s Law’ - legislation to force venues to be prepared for terror attacks, named after one of the victims of the Manchester Arena tragedy. Plans to strengthen the regulation of AI are on the way too.Ministers are under strict instruction not to be categoric about what has made the cut and what has not - even privately. A huge amount of work for the speech was done before Labour’s election win was secure, but the protocol is that these announcements are the monarch’s to make.So until the day itself, we cannot be completely sure if some of the more controversial plans have been passed over this time. Be alert too to the promise of “reviews” or “consultations”. Sometimes taking a good look at a problem before new laws is the logical thing to do – on other occasions, it is a way of placating those arguing for action when ministers aren’t quite ready.', 'If an idea hasn’t made it into the speech this time around, it doesn’t mean it will never happen. Governments are always able to put forward other laws at a later date. But the speech is the government’s formal to-do list, so Wednesday’s priorities are the government’s priorites.Remember, Labour is in a hurry to show they can get things done. Lots of effort has gone in to draft laws that are “tight” and “workable” I’m told, and are ”whole Parliament proof” – meaning laws that can get through the House of Lords.The government has a ginormous majority in the House of Commons, but they have a different audience on the red benches at the other end of the Palace of Westminster. They don’t want to be picking time-consuming fights with the Lords, or creating laws that could be gummed up with hundreds of possible amendments – helpful tweaks - from their lordships.Wednesday will be a huge moment. The buglers will bugle. Black Rod will bang the door. In a nod to the Gunpowder Plot of the 16th Century, the Yeomen of the Guard will conduct a ceremonial search for explosives. The King will wear the crown, and put his name to Labour’s plans for the next couple of years.Hundreds of new MPs will process through the Westminster’s historic halls. And Sir Keir Starmer’s project in Parliament officially begins.', 'Ministers have already been trying hard to tell a story of just how bad the state of the government is that they have inherited. ”You cannot overstate how dysfunctional it has been,” one minister told me. The Justice Secretary late on Friday even accused the Tories of being the “guilty men”.Clearly there is some information that is only available to those actually in government, but it is worth saying that much of the information new ministers are describing as a ‘shock’ - such as waiting lists and the size of the prison population - are a matter of public record. As we discussed last week, there was a conscious decision by Labour, before they won the election, to tell the public “it’s worse than we thought”. One former Tory minister said: “We need to call out this hokum”.Declarations of surprise also don’t quite match Labour’s boast at being incredibly well prepared for government after months of careful homework and talks with senior officials.But perhaps the shock of being in charge is genuine.  One member of the new government said: “I still wake up every morning thinking the previous day is a dream.”The power is real.

Which voters should the Tories go after now?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g6md2lxvo#2,The Conservatives are debating their future - but the path back to victory is not straightforward.,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 01:07:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:20.800893,"['The parliamentary Conservative party is dazed and confused, even grief-stricken.Many knew a big defeat was coming, though some were in denial. All agree that the reality of life in opposition is even worse than expected.“It’s like Lehman Brothers around here,” one Conservative MP muttered, as he saw yet another ousted colleague wander past carrying a cardboard box holding their belongings.“There are a load of MPs I thought I’d be spending decades with in this place,” said another. “They’re really good mates. And almost all of them are gone. It’s a reminder of how vulnerable we all are.”And here’s one of the few remaining members of the Conservatives’ vast 2019 intake: “It’s not great to feel like a greybeard when you’ve only been here four-and-a-half years.”It’s in that emotional state that the remaining MPs need to start answering questions about where to go next. But they are in no hurry to do so. Indeed it’s hard even to know what the right questions are.Most glaring and immediate, of course, is the question of who should succeed Rishi Sunak. The fact that no-one has yet declared their candidacy - and there appears to be no particular clamour for them to do so - tells its own story.As one shadow cabinet minister put it: “Look at 1997 and look at 2005 - 2005 was a lot longer and went a lot better.”In 1997, the last time the Conservatives were ejected from government, John Major was replaced by William Hague within 49 days. In 2005, it took seven months for David Cameron to be chosen to replace Michael Howard. Lord Hague’s four years as leader were forlorn, Lord Cameron led the Conservatives back into government.“The question I hear people asking each other the most,” one Conservative MP said, “is who is our David Cameron?”In some quarters, the drift towards a longer leadership election betrays a lack of enthusiasm for the likely candidates.One influential backbencher suggested that postponing the start of the contest would allow MPs to see how the putative candidates take to the task of opposition, for example responding in the King’s Speech debate or tabling urgent questions to cabinet ministers.For others, though, a long campaign is an opportunity to have a more fundamental debate about how the Conservatives should rebuild.“The problem is we lost votes everywhere at once,” one MP on the right of the party said. “Lots want us to just think about the challenge from Reform, and we must, but we can’t ignore our other former voters.”Consider a couple of constituencies for a moment. ', 'After the 2019 general election, Boston and Skegness was the second-safest Conservative seat in the country. The party won 76.7% of the vote with Labour limping in second on 15.2%. Last week Reform UK claimed the seat, even though the Labour vote stayed roughly the same. If every Conservative loss were like that, the party’s clear incentive would be to focus relentlessly on those voters they lost to Reform.But then look at Stratford-on-Avon. At the 2019 election the Conservatives won this seat with 60.6% of the vote, way ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 24.3%. Last week, the Liberal Democrats won the seat, the first time anyone but a Conservative had won there since 1906. Yet the Conservative vote collapsed in more than one direction. Lots of votes were lost to the Liberal Democrats but Reform claimed 14.6% of the vote too. If those votes had gone to the Conservatives, the party would have just clung on to the seat.', ""That’s before you even get on to all the seats where Conservative voters defected in large numbers to Labour.But it’s far from straightforward to assume that Reform votes would have just flowed to the Conservatives without Nigel Farage’s involvement.“Most Reform voters don’t like the Conservative Party,” says Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester. “They courted them for two years and it did nothing.“Conservatives assume that because most Reform voters backed the Tories in 2019 that they are low-hanging fruit, easy to win back. But this doesn’t follow. They feel let down by the Conservative Party, and just saying nice things to them isn’t going to cut it for them. Even if you can get some of them back you will lose others in doing so.”Even those MPs who think the Conservatives need to prioritise the Reform UK vote admit there is uncertainty about what’s behind the party's surge.“The big question about Reform is whether it’s just about immigration,” one MP on the right of the party said, “or whether it’s also about economics and trust. Some of us think it’s something much bigger, a bit like a Marine Le Pen moment.“If we’re right, then it’s no good just pitching for Reform votes by going harder and harder on immigration, because you can never satisfy enough of them, and with some of them you wouldn’t want to. And in the meantime you’re turning off Lib Dems.”"", 'Another Conservative said: “The answer is we need to find a way to appeal to voters we lost to all parties. I don’t know how you do that on policy, but Keir Starmer showed you can do it by looking competent and serious. But I don’t know if any of the candidates we have at the moment can do that.”Others worry, though, that a long leadership contest will allow Labour to develop new arguments about their inheritance in government from the Conservatives, with the Conservative Party too distracted by internal wrangling to hit back.“The only vulnerability Labour will leave us is on small boats - they really don’t have a plan,” one said. “But we won’t be able to beat them on that because of our record. So that leaves space for Reform.”In opposition, though, the matter of attacking the government is mechanical as much as it is about narrative and policy.And the stark reality of the Conservatives’ depleted ranks is that they are going to find it hard to be an effective opposition. There are likely to be somewhere between 80 and 90 government ministers to shadow. Appoint a shadow frontbencher to correspond to each one and you’re left with only about 30 backbenchers out of 121 MPs. That’s before two deputy speakers.“I guess we’re going to have to pick and choose which jobs we really want to shadow,” one current shadow minister said. “There’s going to be lots of doubling up. I don’t know how that will all work.”From the existential to the mundane - that’s the range of questions a traumatised Conservative Party now has to consider. And they don’t all think they will get it right.“If there’s one thing this campaign has taught me,” one Conservative official said, “it’s that things can always get worse.”', 'BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Now the field of ageing-research is booming as researchers try to uncover - and manipulate - the molecular processes of ageing. The team at the MRC Laboratory of Medical Science, Imperial College London and Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore were investigating a protein called interleukin-11.Levels of it increase in the human body as we get older, it contributes to higher levels of inflammation, and the researchers say it flips several biological switches that control the pace of ageing. ', 'The researchers performed two experiments. The first genetically engineered mice so they were unable to produce interleukin-11The second waited until mice were 75 weeks old (roughly equivalent to a 55-year-old person) and then regularly gave them a drug to purge interleukin-11 from their bodies The results, published in the journal Nature, showed lifespans were increased by 20-25% depending on the experiment and sex of the mice.Old laboratory mice often die from cancer, however, the mice lacking interleukin-11 had far lower levels of the disease.And they showed improved muscle function, were leaner, had healthier fur and scored better on many measures of frailty. ', 'I asked one of the researchers, Prof Stuart Cook, whether the data was too good to be believed.He told me: ""I try not to get too excited, for the reasons you say, is it too good to be true? ""There\'s lots of snake oil out there, so I try to stick to the data and they are the strongest out there.""He said he ""definitely"" thought it was worth trialling in human ageing, arguing that the impact ""would be transformative"" if it worked and was prepared to take it himself.', 'The big unanswered questions are could the same effect be achieved in people, and whether any side effects would be tolerable.Interleukin-11 does have a role in the human body during early development.People are, very rarely, born unable to make it. This alters how the bones in their skull fuse together, affects their joints, which can need surgery to correct, and how their teeth emerge. It also has a role in scarring. The researchers think that later in life, interleukin-11 is playing the bad role of driving ageing.The drug, a manufactured antibody that attacks interleukin-11, is being trialled in patients with lung fibrosis. This is where the lungs become scarred, making it harder to breathe. Prof Cook said the trials had not been completed, however, the data suggested the drug was safe to take.This is just the latest approach to ""treating"" ageing with drugs. The type-2 diabetes drug metformin and rapamycin, which is taken to prevent an organ transplant being rejected, are both actively being researched for their anti-ageing qualities.Prof Cook thinks a drug is likely to be easier for people than calorie restriction.

More money and staff – so why isn't the NHS more productive?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0dmvdmmv80o#0,Labour has launched an investigation into what's wrong with the NHS. Is productivity the place to start?,"Sun, 14 Jul 2024 02:32:41 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:25.169595,"['The new government has made tackling NHS waiting times a key priority - and this week appointed NHS surgeon and former health minister Lord Ara Darzi to investigate what is going wrong. Is productivity the place to start?The scale of the challenge facing Health Secretary Wes Streeting was made clear as he announced the review on Thursday. The latest performance figures – the first published since the election - showed the hospital backlog had risen again for a second month in a row, hitting 7.6 million. The British Medical Association called it a ""shameful"" legacy for the Tories to leave.In its manifesto, Labour insisted it had a plan to tackle this - creating an extra 40,000 appointments and operations a month, by getting the NHS to do more at weekends as well as using the private sector more.It has pointed to hospitals in London and Leeds that have had great success in doing weekend working, which has allowed them to improve efficiency through high-intensity use of operating theatres. Surgeons carry out the operations across two theatres with one being used to operate on the patient, while the next patient is readied in the other.But these are the exceptions. If you look across the entire NHS, hospitals have actually struggled to increase activity despite more money being invested and more staff being employed. Compared to five years ago, spending after inflation has risen by nearly a fifth and the workforce by nearly a quarter, yet the number of patients starting treatment for things such as knee and hip replacements, has barely increased.', 'The strikes by junior doctors and other staff seen over the past year have had an impact. NHS England estimates that during 2023-24, 350,000 more treatments would have been started if there had been no industrial action. But even that leaves hospitals well short of what you would have expected, if treatments had gone up by as much as spending and staffing.It is a similar picture if you look at all types of treatment, including follow-up checks and pre-treatment tests and scans, not just those starting their core treatment and therefore coming off the waiting list.', 'This productivity puzzle – as the Institute for Government (IfG) calls it – has been a cause of concern at the heart of government for some time.During an election debate in front of health leaders last month, a candid Lord Bethell, who served as a health minister in the last government, said the Treasury had become ""sick to death"" of pouring money into the health service only to see productivity fail to improve: ""They [the Treasury] believe the return on investment is terrible.""But it is not just in the corridors of Westminster that the perception has developed. The public is also concerned, according to Anna Quigley, research director at Ipsos UK: ""Generally around eight in 10 say they are willing to pay more tax to fund the NHS. But they also say it needs to make changes - cut out waste and inefficiency.""The temptation is to assume it was the pandemic that threw a spanner in the works – after all it led to a dramatic fall in treatments being done, and the waiting list to balloon. Could it be that the NHS is still recovering from the shock of that?The IfG analysis of the problem published last year suggests not.Focusing on treatments is just one rather blunt mark of productivity, so the IfG looked at a range of different measures - and found the NHS actually started to become less productive in the late 2010s after about 15 years of improving productivity.It was clear, the IfG concluded, the pandemic may have pulled the trigger, but the gun was loaded well before Covid struck. The Nuffield Trust has come to a similar conclusion in an analysis published this week, pointing out the NHS has struggled more than other countries, such as Finland and Spain, to get waiting times down since the peak of the pandemic. It\'s director of research Sarah Scobie says the new government faces an ""enormous uphill battle"" to get the NHS back on track.', 'So what\'s causing the problems? In a system as complex as the NHS there will never be a single reason for something.The lack of spending on buildings is a key factor, the IfG said.As funding has been squeezed, the repair bill for the NHS estate has been creeping up and stands at £11.6bn – a rise of 13.6% on the previous year.The consequence of this is that every year thousands of patients see their care disrupted because of incidents relating to infrastructure problems.A BBC investigation earlier this year found problems including patients waiting for dialysis being sent home because of water supply issues, power being lost in operating theatres and sewage leaking into patient areas.The lack of spending on buildings and equipment – known as capital spending – also means the NHS has one of the lowest number of scanners among rich nations, creating a bottleneck for tests to diagnose health problems. The lack of 21st century IT systems is another well-known problem.The IfG also highlighted delayed discharges. This is when patients are medically fit to leave hospital but cannot, because of the lack of care in the community.Every day around one in nine hospital beds is occupied by someone in this position.""It\'s clogging up the whole system,"" says Sally Warren, director of policy at the King’s Fund think tank, who is now moving to the Department of Health and Social Care to oversee a new 10-year strategy for the government: ""It\'s a huge inefficiency.""', 'Ms Warren, who spoke to the BBC before her appointment to government was confirmed, also highlights workforce factors as a problem, including high rates of sickness and low morale, as well as the increasing number of less experienced staff - something that often gets overlooked when staffing figures are discussed.Research by the Nuffield Trust has shown that over the past five years the number of newly qualified nurses – those with less than a year\'s experience – has nearly doubled as a proportion of the workforce, to one in 14.""The NHS has lost a lot of its long-serving staff – and that hasn\'t helped. There is some evidence that having a less experienced workforce leads to a more risk-averse approach,"" says Ms Warren.', ""She adds that this has several consequences, from keeping people in hospital too long to being too ready to admit them.It is a point acknowledged by NHS England's recent review of productivity, which accepted hospitals in particular had become less efficient.That review also highlighted spending on agency staff to plug gaps caused by staff sickness and vacancies – while the number of staff being employed has gone up, one in 13 posts are still vacant.It means an increasingly desperate NHS can find itself paying over-the-odds to get cover, with research showing some paying out up to £2,500 to fill nursing shifts."", 'The money situation is also not as clear-cut as it would seem. While the NHS budget has gone up, the rises have not been as much as the NHS was traditionally used to.Historically, the budget has increased by around 3-4% above inflation on average – a figure many experts see as necessary to keep pace with the ageing population and advances in medicine.But during the 2010s it was limited to 1% to 2%. Over the last parliament it was higher, but still below the historical average.', 'One of the problems, says Ms Warren, is that was only because of the emergency bailouts that were given.By their very nature, she says, they have tended to come ""as late as humanly possible"" and often in ring-fenced pots, which has not made for good financial decision-making: ""You could improve the NHS with less if you had a settled three-year funding settlement.""That\'s something senior NHS leaders agree with whole-heartedly. Last year the final tranche of winter funding came in January – after the peak in pressures had hit.""It was crazy,"" one hospital chief executive told me. ""We had just battled through some of the toughest weeks many of us had seen – we should have had the money months and months before. In theory, that should be fairly easy to resolve – the other problems holding us back aren\'t.""']"

MS affects more than 150,000 people in the UK, with some 135 people diagnosed each week.The lifelong condition is caused by a person's immune system mistakenly attacking the protective covering that surrounds nerves in the brain and spinal cord.Messages travelling along the nerves may become slowed or disrupted.This can lead to a range of problems including difficulties with eyesight, movement, sensation and balance, and it can cause serious disability. Ocrelizumab (also known as ocrevus) which is given twice a year, targets a specific part of the immune system, helping to lessen the attack. It can be used for two forms of the disease -  active relapsing MS and early primary progressive MS.  In the most common, relapsing remitting type of MS, the disease waxes and wanes with episodes or flares where MS is active.In other cases it be progressive, with symptoms gradually worsening.

She currently takes the drug as an infusion but says the injection would make a significant difference to her, allowing her have more time with her young family. ""Ocrelizumab is working well for me right now and making me hopeful for a better and healthier future, but to be able to have an injection would be much more convenient to me,"" she said.""At the moment it takes around four or five hours to have my infusion and the logistics can be really difficult. ""I have two children under 10, so sorting out childcare can be challenging.""', 'Prof Sir Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said ocrelizumab had ""represented a huge advance in care in recent years"" as the first drug able to change the course of MS.He added: “This new injection will drastically cut the time that regular treatment takes for those living with multiple sclerosis, meaning that thousands of patients can spend less time in hospital while helping free up clinicians’ time to see more patients, as well as [provide] vital capacity on wards.""The MS Society charity welcomed the decision to license the injections and the greater choice patients will have about how they take their medication. Ocrelizumab is manufactured by Roche, and was first approved in the UK in 2018. Other injectable treatments for relapsing MS include ofatumumab, which can be done by patients at home. ']"

But although their unreasonably high sense of self-importance may mellow, they do not fully grow out of it, the study involving more than 37,000 people suggests. Those who were more narcissistic than their peers as children tended to remain that way as adults, investigators found.And there are at least three types of narcissistic behaviour to look for, they say.', 'Narcissist has become an insult often hurled at people who are perceived as difficult or diagreeable. We all may show some narcissistic traits at times.Doctors use the term to describe a specific, diagnosable type of personality disorder.Although definitions can vary, common themes shared by those who have it is an unshakeable belief they are better or more deserving than other people, which might be described by others as arrogance and selfishness. The work, published in the journal Psychological Bulletin, comes from data from 51 past studies, involving 37,247 participants who ranged in age from eight to 77.Researchers looked for three types of narcissist, based on behaviour traits:Agentic narcissists - who feel grand or superior to others and crave admirationAntagonistic narcissists - who see others as rivals and are exploitative and lack empathy Neurotic narcissists - who are shame-prone, insecure and overly sensitive to criticismThey studied what happened to these personality measures over time, based on questionnaires, and found that, generally, narcissism scores declined with age. However, the changes were slight and gradual. ""Clearly, some individuals may change more strongly, but generally, you wouldn’t expect someone you knew as a very narcissistic person to have completely changed when you meet them again after some years,"" lead researcher Dr Ulrich Orth, from the University of Bern in Switzerland, told BBC News. He says some narcissistic traits can be helpful, at least in the short term. It might boost your popularity, dating success, and chance of landing a top job, for example. But over longer periods, the consequences are mostly negative, because of the conflict it causes.""These consequences do not only affect the person themselves, but also the wellbeing of individuals with whom they interact, such as partners, children, friends, co-workers, and employees,"" he explained. Dr Sarah Davies is a chartered counselling psychologist who has written a book on how to leave a narcissist. She told the BBC that although people may be arrogant or selfish at times, that should not be confused with true clinical narcissism. ""Narcissists tend to be envious and jealous of others and they are highly exploitative and manipulative,"" she said. ""They do not experience remorse or feeling bad, or have a sense of responsibility like other non-narcissistic people do.""She says there has been a boom in interest about narcissism, driven by social media. ""To some extent that\'s helpful - it helps inform more people about it and to bring more awareness of this issue. However, like many mental health terms, the clinical meaning can get a little lost.Dr Davies says we should be more discerning with the term.""I find it much more useful to be specific with naming behaviours and separate them. For example, a friend of mine recently called her ex a narcissist because he had ghosted her after they broke up. ""Being ghosted [suddenly cutting someone out of your life without explanation] is of course horrible, but he may not have been able to deal with a conversation after their relationship came to an end. It doesn’t necessarily mean he is a raging narcissist. ""They were together a while and there were no other indications of his \'narcissism\'."" According to Dr Davies, some signs you may be involved with or around a narcissist include:Constant drama - a narcissist needs to be needed and seeks chaos and conflictNo genuine apologies - they never really take full responsibility for their own behavioursBlame game - they manipulate and exploit others for their own selfish gainsDr Tennyson Lee is a consultant psychiatrist with the Deancross Personality Disorder Service, based in the London borough of Tower Hamlets. He said the study was well-conducted and the findings were useful. ""The good news is narcissism typically reduces with age. The bad news is this reduction is not of a high magnitude.""Do not expect narcissism will dramatically improve at a certain age - it doesn\'t. ""This has implications for the long-suffering spouse who thinks \'an improvement is just around the corner\',"" he told BBC News.If you, or someone you know, have been affected by any of the issues raised, support is available.', '']"

It\'s common, but it\'s not normal.""We need better research in this area because we don\'t fully understand any treatments. ""The case now is we offer you a hysterectomy - in my opinion that is atrocious that that\'s the only option we are offering women.""She adds there should be better education for GPs, with women\'s health being a mandatory topic at medical school and ongoing in practice.The Department of Health and Social Care said Health Secretary Wes Streeting had ordered a ""full and independent"" investigation into the state of the health service and its findings would feed into the government\'s 10-year plan for ""deep-rooted reform"".""It is unacceptable that too many women are not receiving the care they deserve, and we are determined to change that,"" a spokesperson added.""Never again will women’s health be neglected.

Mum admits ending life of terminally ill son,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn33z53pv3vo#1,"Police say they are investigating reports relating to ""an apparent case of assisted dying"" in 1981.","Wed, 03 Jul 2024 16:50:46 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:25.170188,"['A mother has admitted giving her terminally ill seven-year-old son a large dose of morphine to stop his suffering and ""quietly end his life"".Antonya Cooper, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said her son Hamish had stage 4 cancer and was in “a lot of pain” before his death in 1981.Now facing a terminal diagnosis herself, she made the admission to BBC Radio Oxford as part of an effort to change the law on assisted dying.Police said they were investigating her case. Assisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - and euthanasia - deliberately ending a person\'s life - are illegal in England. ', 'Hamish had neuroblastoma, a rare cancer that mostly affects children.He was five when diagnosed and was initially given a prognosis of three months.Following 16 months of ""beastly"" cancer treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital, his life was extended but he was left in great pain, according to his mother.She said: ""On Hamish\'s last night, when he said he was in a lot of pain, I said: \'Would you like me to remove the pain?\' and he said: \'Yes please, mama.\'""And through his Hickman Catheter, I gave him a large dose of morphine that did quietly end his life.""', 'BBC Radio Oxford asked the 77-year-old if she believed her son knew she was intending to end his life.She replied: ""I feel very strongly that at the point of Hamish telling me he was in pain, and asking me if I could remove his pain, he knew, he knew somewhere what was going to happen.""But I cannot obviously tell you why or how, but I was his mother, he loved his mother, and I totally loved him, and I was not going to let him suffer, and I feel he really knew where he was going.""She continued: ""It was the right thing to do. My son was facing the most horrendous suffering and intense pain, I was not going to allow him to go through that.""Asked if she understood she was potentially admitting to manslaughter or murder, she replied: ""Yes.""""If they come 43 years after I have allowed Hamish to die peacefully, then I would have to face the consequences. But they would have to be quick, because I\'m dying too,"" she added.', 'Four decades after Hamish\'s death, his mother is coming to terms with her own incurable cancer.She said his suffering and her own ill health had cemented her feelings on assisted deaths.""We don\'t do it to our pets. Why should we do it to humans?"" she said.Campaigners for a so-called ""right to die"" have argued that people should be able to choose when and how to die in order to avoid suffering.Critics have said changing the law would ""place pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives"" for fear of being a financial or emotional burden.MPs recently discussed the issue at a parliamentary debate, at which the government said it was a matter of conscience for individual parliamentarians rather than one for government policy.', 'In a statement, Thames Valley Police said it was ""aware of reports relating to an apparent case of assisted dying of a seven-year-old boy in 1981"".It added: ""At this early stage, the force is making inquiries into these reports and is not in a position to comment further while these investigations continue.""', 'This is a hugely complex and highly controversial subject, and yet it is one that is gaining momentum.Assisted dying is the phrase used to describe a situation where someone who is terminally ill seeks medical help to obtain lethal drugs which they administer themselves. Assisted suicide, is helping another person end their life.Both are illegal in the UK but recently, Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man all announced they are considering changing the law to let terminally ill people end their lives.One hundred and ninety cases have been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service over a 15 year period.

In October, she died by suicide.""[Politicians] need to wake up to the mental health crisis they\'re facing,"" said Amelia\'s mother, Becci Butlin.', '""This generation is the first that is using social media in unbelievable ways and with unbelievable dependency on it,"" she added.""They\'ve got all the other stresses of life, they had a difficult teenage period with Covid and there are significantly more mental health issues to come.""No-one\'s talking about it. It\'s a much wider problem than anyone acknowledges.""Naomi Woodford, a mental health support worker at Cedars Upper School, in Leighton Buzzard, which Amelia attended, was among many people who have contacted the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote to tell us mental health is the most important issue for them during this election. Ms Woodford works with children and teenagers, some of whom have been affected by the death of Amelia, and believes every school, college and university in the UK should have its own mental health provision.She described the situation as a ""national crisis"", and expressed concern that out of 14 schools in the Leighton Buzzard area, only two or three have the resources to offer pupils mental health support.According to the Office for National Statistics, in 2021 more people in England and Wales died by suicide than in 2020. The data showed 6.9% more deaths by suicide were registered than in 2020.', 'Amelia\'s mother said she was not aware of mental health care being a key priority for any of the main parties, but believed the next government should focus on the approach in schools and by GPs, to ensure those in need of specialist care get a referral as soon as possible.""The real problem is the complexity of getting the right help,"" said Ms Butlin.""Schools aren\'t equipped for helping children and teenagers and Amelia had left school, so that is even worse. ""If you go through the NHS you are met with huge waiting lists, if you go the private route then there is no-one guiding you.""Ms Butlin recently joined 25 of her daughter\'s friends on a 15km (nine mile) walk in Amelia\'s memory and to raise money for the suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably ""We\'ve seen the impact suicide has - it has rippled through her friendship group and the community,"" Ms Butlin added.""It is important in tragic circumstances to bring people together to do something positive and tangible, and to have that focus that other lives might be saved.""', 'Alicia Down, 19, a friend of Amelia\'s, said: ""Amelia was the loss of our lives, it\'s been heartbreaking.""""We\'ve struggled a lot; it has a domino effect. ""When she passed away all of us got the same feelings of depression.""Losing her has ripped us all to shreds and ruined us, and she is constantly on our minds.""Ms Down expressed concern over social media and its impact on young people\'s confidence, and said schools and universities were not equipped to offer support when people needed help. If counselling was offered, she said, it was ""six sessions, and then you\'re off"".', 'Charlotte Millar, 20, a university student, said that many young people were not prepared for university life.While her and Amelia\'s friendship circle stayed in touch and supported each other through the pandemic, they were then launched into the stress of A-levels and moving to university.""No matter how independent you think you are, you have no idea what\'s to come at university,"" she said. ""You have to make new friends, study and live on your own. ""That\'s my biggest stress, but you\'re not defined by a degree and that\'s not spoken about enough.""She understood that asking for help was not easy, but universities could also be more flexible when students felt ""swamped"".', 'Emily Ferguson, 20, a friend of Amelia\'s, said she found it hard to put down her phone and ignore social media. ""There is such a pressure to be a certain way, so it\'s difficult to feel that you\'re fine as you are,"" she said.""You see people always going out at uni, but you don\'t have to go on every student night out, every party, you can just go home if you want to. ""A lot of people want to post about what they\'re doing, but then they don\'t appreciate the time with whoever they\'re with.""You don\'t have to prove to the world - people don\'t care that much.""', 'Ms Woodford said: ""The community of Leighton Buzzard and Cedars has been deeply affected over the years with young people taking their lives.""We have seen a rise in the range and amount of mental health issues since the pandemic, along with exam stress, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating issues.""We are in a national crisis, we can\'t hang on for a one-year, two-year or five-year plan, it needs to happen now.""We need emergency intervention, we need mental health provision in all our schools, colleges and universities in UK, and I will campaign to make that happen.""', ""Labour says it will introduce specialist mental health support for children and young people in every school.

Hugh Pym: Is sugar the missing ingredient in election manifestos?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgxq2qdlj9lo#1,"Sugar taxes have been widely debated but in party manifestos, the word ""sugar"" barely appears. Why?","Sat, 29 Jun 2024 23:33:14 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:25.170474,"['There was a lot to chew on in the party manifestos on health and the NHS, with promises to cut waiting lists, modernise hospitals and create more GP and dentist appointments.But plans around prevention were in short supply on these political menus - as were proposals about how to help us stay healthier.With a developing obesity and diabetes crisis, as well as increasing numbers of children needing emergency treatment because of rotting teeth, some experts say keeping people out of hospital is just as important as caring for them once they get ill. A recent report from the Health Foundation think tank concluded that ""the nation’s health is fraying, placing a growing burden on public services and limiting future prosperity. Much of this ill-health could be prevented."" Tackling sugar consumption would be a vital part of any drive to improve the population’s health, but the word ""sugar"" only appears twice in total in the manifestos of the five main parties in England. That\'s surprising given that policies to curb sugar consumption and regulate unhealthy food products have been debated very publicly for nearly a decade.In 2015, chef Jamie Oliver started his own campaign for a sugar tax, after filming a six-year-old-boy having rotten teeth pulled out under general anaesthetic for a TV documentary.The government did introduce a tax on high-sugar soft drinks in 2018. Manufacturers anxious to avoid paying it cut sugar levels in their products so that they fell below the levy threshold. The Institute for Government reported that total sugar sold in soft drinks fell by more than 35% between 2015 and 2019.Attention then turned to sugary foods. Public Health England (which has since been abolished) started publishing league tables of the sugar content of items like biscuits, cakes and cereals. There was a veiled threat by officials and some ministers of a levy.In his final weeks in office in 2016, then-Prime Minister David Cameron was close to unveiling plans to ban ""buy one get one free"" deals for unhealthy products in supermarkets and restrict TV ads for junk food and other high-sugar products.', 'But like unwanted leftovers on a plate, those plans were cast aside by his successors at 10 Downing Street. Theresa May and Boris Johnson were unimpressed by the menu of anti-obesity policies and sceptical about the state intervening in public health. The government, it was argued, should not interfere in people\'s decisions about what to eat and drink.The pandemic complicated these debates as ministers and officials focused solely on tackling Covid-19. And when soaring food price inflation took a toll on households, politicians argued that adding a tax on sugary foods would not be fair.The result of all this? Restrictions on where unhealthy products can be promoted in supermarkets have been introduced in England. But other policies discussed on and off for a decade have been postponed until October 2025.  The ban on advertising these items on broadcast outlets before 21:00 and at any time online will not start until then. There will also be a ban on ""buy one get one free"" promotions.The delay was announced in June 2023 by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who explained his thinking: ""At a time when household budgets are under continuing pressure from the global rise in food prices it is not fair for government to restrict the options available to consumers on their weekly shop.""', 'In England the proportion of adults classified as overweight or obese increased from 61.2% in 2015-16, to 63.8% in 2021-22, according to government data.Opponents of the sugar tax on drinks may point to those figures to argue that it didn\'t have enough impact. Supporters will say the numbers would have been worse if the levy had not been imposed. A study last year published in PLOS Medicine concluded that it was ""associated with decreased prevalence of obesity in year six girls, with the greatest differences in those living in the most deprived areas"".Internationally, the statistics make for depressing reading. A report in The Lancet in February stated that, based on 2022 data, more than one billion people globally were living with obesity. The UK, with 27% of men reported to be obese, fared worse than Germany (23%), Spain (19%), Italy (18%), and France (10%).The financial pressures are obvious. The costs associated with diabetes care are rising fast. University of York research concludes that diabetes cost the UK nearly £14bn in 2021-22 – with more than £10bn for the NHS. Demand for weight-loss drugs for diabetics such as Wegovy is expected to rise sharply. Doctors say the risk of type 2 diabetes can be lowered by healthy diet and exercise.', 'The stats are clear, but what is the reality for patients? Professor Kamila Hawthorne is president of the Royal College of GPs. A few years ago she moved to a practice in a deprived area of South Wales where she sees many overweight and obese patients. They are more likely to develop back and knee pain and so need time off work, she says. They are also at higher risk of developing diabetes, cancer or high blood pressure. GPs can encourage people to move to healthier diets, Prof Hawthorne adds, but there is only so much they can do.With many of her patients holding down several jobs while raising kids ""they just don’t have time and so go for takeaways"", she says. ""They know what the problem is and they have tried to lose weight but they often feel helpless"".Dr Jack Jacobs, a GP who practices near Ashford in Kent, says diabetic and pre-diabetic numbers have increased by about 50% over five years and mainly in younger adults. He says local GP surgeries have employed a health coach to promote activity such as Couch to 5k but ""there seems to be a lack of effort on education around diet and lifestyle - its astonishing that some teenagers and young adults just don’t seem to understand what exercise is"".The British Medical Journal has reported that one in six integrated care boards, responsible for managing health services in their region, have stopped taking on patients for specialist weight management services. Patient numbers were said to have spiralled out of control with demand far exceeding capacity. An academic expert told the BMJ that where services do exist they are often over-subscribed and at risk of budget cuts.Some other experts are saying that only a cross-government approach will be adequate to tackle the problems. Professor Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard, Head of health analytics at the consultancy firm LCP, says it must be a priority for all Whitehall departments: “The links between ill-health and poor economic outcomes are increasingly clear. Preventing the onset of illness is key to managing the complex demand for healthcare as well as underpinning health-driven prosperity.”', 'So why have political leaders not done more? Clearly some have been concerned about accusations of a “nanny state” if restrictions are imposed. Business leaders also tend to push back when new taxes on food are proposed.The Food and Drink Federation says these taxes will not drive “reformulation”. This is industry-speak for creating new recipes with fewer unhealthy ingredients while attempting not to lose customers.In a statement a spokesperson said: “The food and drink industry knows it has an important role to play in tackling obesity and poor diets and we would welcome the opportunity to work with government and others to find solutions to better support balanced diets and healthier lifestyles. The industry also continues to invest in the innovation necessary to alter the recipes of much-loved products to make them healthier, by removing fat, salt and sugar, and adding additional fruit, vegetables and fibre, giving consumers a broader choice of healthier food and drink.”Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have developed their own obesity strategies. All four UK nations have tended to defend existing policies and point to bold ambitions for intervention. But as the debate around the sustainability of the NHS intensifies, a broader discussion about health will be required - and that has not been forthcoming in this campaign.The snag is that devising joined-up policies across different departments will take time and does not make for snappy manifesto headlines.But as Amanda Pritchard, the head of NHS England, said in a recent speech: ""Will we tackle problems at source, or do we accept the NHS becomes an expensive safety net?""', 'BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

How to pull off an election all-nighter,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c047gr9mgxxo#1,"You want to watch the results, but you also have a life to live... we have the plan to get you through. ","Thu, 04 Jul 2024 02:36:19 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:25.170587,"[""Hello there election enthusiasts!I love the idea of a full night of election drama - sitting up in front of the television, the BBC News live page updating on my laptop, slowly converting a mountain of snacks into a wasteland of empty wrappers and mainlining unseemly quantities of tea. But we’re fighting biology here, fellow election-night crew.So I’ve been chatting to sleep experts to come up with the definitive guide to getting through the night and not becoming a sleep-deprived monster the next day. I'm going for the hardcore plan - we've got to be up all day Thursday whether that's for work or childcare, then we're watching the whole thing overnight and we're back in the office on Friday. There's a milder plan too (that we'll discuss at the end) but all the tips here will help you see democracy in action."", ""In an ideal world you need to be well-rested before you even get to Thursday night. There's no such thing as “sleep banking” ahead of time but if you're already wrecked then it's going to be a struggle.The core of our plan is going to involve a solid nap strategy. Napping cannot replace the remarkable restorative power of a night’s sleep but it is scientifically proven to boost alertness and concentration levels - essential for keeping up with the results.“If you’re staying up all night, I’d have a pre-emptive nap before it starts and have another in the middle of the night,” says Dr Allie Hare, a sleep medicine consultant at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London.Nap three is on Friday morning, pre-work or pre-school-run, to get us out of the door, and number four is in the middle of the day. “There’s a natural lull after lunch so that’s a good time to do it,” says Dr Hare.She thinks the “push through Friday” approach is best for most people in order to avoid completely disrupting their usual sleeping pattern."", 'LIVE: Follow all the latest general election results newsKeir Starmer set to be prime minister - exit pollExit poll: What is the forecast in my area?General election 2024: All BBC stories and analysisElection results night: Your essential guide', ""Nap technique is a delicate art. You’re aiming for 20-30 minutes in order to get a restorative boost, but go any longer and you’ll mess yourself up. “If you drop into a deeper sleep, coming out of that can leave you really groggy,” says Professor Russell Foster from the University of Oxford.It's called sleep inertia - that feeling when you wake up worse than when you nodded off.Nap-pros have perfected the art of “pre-loading” and this comes expert-recommended.The idea is if you have a coffee immediately before your 20-minute nap (set a timer on your phone) and then the caffeine hits its peak just as the nap ends, you’re perky and ready to go as soon as you wake up.“It’s a good idea,” says Prof Foster.So I'm thinking naps at 21:00 on Thursday, then 02:00, 06:00 and 14:00 on Friday - but make that pattern work for you.You are still going to feel tired, so bright lights are your friends. During the night, keep the lights on full-whack, and during the day, spend your time outside to trick your brain into thinking you're supposed to be awake."", ""If you want to stay wired throughout the night then the odds are you’re going to need a performance-enhancing drug - hello caffeine! The drug is a stimulant so it makes you feel less tired and more alert. But again, we need a plan and we don't want too much.Prof Foster argues for the judicious use of tea and coffee, but would “personally avoid” energy drinks as they are packed with sugar.“You will crash afterwards and go in completely the opposite direction,” he says.However, energy drinks do give you a bigger caffeine hit. You could hunt out a zero-sugar option, but don't go overboard.“Don’t overdose on the caffeine and have palpitations and anxiety,” says Dr Hare.You’re also going to want to leave several hours for the caffeine to wear off so it doesn’t disrupt Friday night's sleep. Put the kettle down by mid-afternoon on Friday.Oh, and remember to keep yourself well-hydrated overnight in order to keep that brain ticking over. Not just coffee - water too. And whether you're celebrating, commiserating or just along for the ride, booze could be fun. It is not, however, an elite strategy. “Do not have alcohol involved in any of this - I realise everyone will but the sleep advice is don't, it's just a sedative and it'll make it harder,” says Dr Hare."", ""You're going to have to accept that disrupting your sleep is going to have a knock-on effect on your hunger hormones. Your brain will sense levels of the hormone leptin dropping and ghrelin shooting up, and the combined effect is that you will feel the urge to binge. “You will have cravings and be tempted to send out for pizza and grab the Twixes,” says Prof Foster. “So beware, you’ll be more hungry.” You can't really dodge this but you can plan for it, surrounding yourself with food focused on protein and slow-release carbohydrates. Prof Foster suggests protein drinks or unsalted nuts to provide energy without sending blood sugar levels on a rollercoaster of highs and crashes.“As a treat, you could throw some raisins in,” he chuckles.But don't rely on that box of chocolates. Dr Hare's advice is: “Don’t eat crap all night.” If you try, she says you will feel “absolutely dreadful”."", ""Well done! You’ve made it through the night.I hate to break it to you - you might not be a very nice person right now.Even one night without sleep alters the brain’s ability to process information and emotions.Classic signs are increased irritability and anxiety, and a loss of empathy. Frustration is also a classic, as well as increased impulsivity.Prof Foster says: “You are just not the normal, nice, measured individual you would otherwise be.”You're going to suffer from negative salience too. This is where your world-view becomes warped and negative comments and experiences hit harder. A tired brain also leads to increased risk-taking. Prof Foster says this can make you “more likely to drift into illegal drug use… that’s what your brain does when tired and emotional”. So yeah, watch out for that."", ""I hope it's clear that you're not really you right now, so you might want to take things easy and avoid any difficult conversations.“You might be thrilled with the result and be disinhibited, or less than happy and more reactive to being provoked,” says Prof Foster. So think twice about having 'that' conversation and save life-changing decisions until later.“You certainly need to be sensitive to those difficult conversations,” says Prof Foster.Also - do not drive. After an all-nighter, if you need to get somewhere, then walk, take a taxi or use public transport. By four or five in the morning your brain is as impaired as if you had enough booze to be over the drink-drive limit.“Big decisions, meaningful marital conversations and driving - do not do any of these things,” says Dr Hare."", ""Shift workers may be laughing their way through this piece thinking, “What a bunch of lightweights!”If you had a long run-up you could try shifting your body clock so you're awake at night and asleep for the day, but it's probably too late for that now. Some people do attempt a different strategy to the all-nighter, though. The idea is to stay up to watch the exit-poll projections, which give you the first hint of the result when it is released at 22:00. Then have a sleep for a few hours while the ballots are being counted, and wake up early in the morning to catch the peak of the action. This does hit the problem of sleep inertia we mentioned earlier, but Prof Foster says older people will find this easier to pull off.Sleep patterns change as we age and older people will “have more fragmented sleep” so it is easier for them to wake and feel okay. On the other hand, young people who are woken by an alarm “feel groggy and crap”.“People will know what works for them,” he says.The other idea is to sleep on Friday morning if you don't have any commitments. Just be careful you don't KO all day and then can't sleep on Friday night, throwing your whole weekend out of kilter. Dr Hare says: “If you do have to make major decisions then get whatever sleep you can, even if it messes up your following night's sleep, otherwise power-nap through it.”So good luck, brave election adventurers - whatever you do, you should be fine by Monday. See you on the other side! ""]"

What else do we know right now?', ""Possibly, but it is difficult to tell.We do know there has been a very small increase in the number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid.The number went up to 3.31 admissions per 100,000 in the week to 16 June, compared with 2.67 per 100,000 in the previous week.The largest group of people hospitalised with Covid were those aged 85 and over.In terms of how many people have Covid and stay at home, it is difficult to say.We no longer collect national data in the way we used to, as far less testing takes place now.That means many cases of Covid are not being recorded in the general population.The data we do have is based on laboratory tests taken across the country, mostly swabs taken from people in the healthcare system.*According to this data, per 100,000 people admitted to hospital in England on 26 June, 4.37 had symptoms or were sick enough to be tested and found positive for Covid.Hospitals no longer test everyone who is admitted so this figure does not reflect the Covid rate among all hospital patients, which is likely to be higher.Rates of Covid go up and down throughout the year, without necessarily becoming a cause for concern.Prof Paul Hunter, an epidemiology expert from the University of East Anglia, told the BBC he did not believe the current Covid rates were concerning.“I think we're probably seeing about as much infection this year as we were seeing last year - a little bit less, but not hugely less.”He believes that generally, we are seeing far fewer deaths and far fewer hospitalisations from Covid than last year."", 'In recent months, we have seen a new group of variants of Covid emerge, collectively nicknamed as FLiRT.They are descended from the dominant JN.1 variant, which is itself a sub-variant of the Omicron strain of Covid.Together they are accounting for many current Covid cases in England. The KP3 variant, which has driven a rise in cases in the US, has also been identified in the UK in small numbers.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it needed “more data” on the new variants to understand how severe and transmissible they might be.The agency, which is responsible for public health, also said it was “impossible” to tell at this stage whether these variants were behind the small rise in hospital admissions.As it does with all new strains, the UKHSA said it would “continue to monitor these variants” in the UK and internationally and would gather more information on how well the vaccines protect people against them.But the agency said there was no current change to public health advice.It is normal for a virus to change and mutate and the UKHSA says the healthcare system is still “getting to grips” with the ebb and flow of cases.Prof Hunter said Covid was now part of life and should not be as alarming as it once was. He said: “We are all of us going to get repeated Covid infections from births through to death.""Generally what we\'ve seen is that over the last three years, four years, the severity of illness associated with Covid has gone down a lot.""Ultimately, it\'s going to become another cause of the common cold and, for many people, that\'s what it is now.""He added: “To be honest, you can\'t really avoid it because it\'s so common.”', 'The official list of Covid symptoms has not changed, according to the UKHSA.General symptoms can include:High temperature or shiveringNew, continuous coughLoss or change to your sense of smell or tasteShortness of breathFeeling tired or exhaustedAching bodyHeadacheSore throatBlocked or runny noseLoss of appetiteDiarrhoeaFeeling sick or being sick', 'There are no longer any legal restrictions requiring people to self-isolate if they have Covid. You also do not need to take a lateral flow test and there is no requirement to wear masks.However, government advice is to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days after testing positive.People should also avoid meeting people who are more likely to fall seriously ill if they were to catch Covid, such as elderly people or those with weakened immune systems.“If you are showing symptoms of Covid-19 or flu, help protect others by staying at home and avoiding contact with other people, especially those who are more vulnerable,” the UKHSA’s consultant epidemiologist Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal said.', 'The vaccine programme has been scaled back since the initial rollouts early in the pandemic. Now, only certain people are entitled to jabs under seasonal booster programmes.They are:Aged 75 or overPeople with a weakened immune systemAdults who live in care homesVaccines are good at preventing severe Covid symptoms but they do not necessarily stop you becoming infected. NHS England previously urged anyone who was eligible for the jab to get vaccinated before the spring booster programme ended on Sunday, 30 June.The latest data showed four million people - 59.6% of those eligible - had been vaccinated under the scheme since April, including two-thirds of care home residents.Vaccinations are also available privately to anyone who can afford to pay for them.', '*Clarification 2nd July 2024: To simplify the article, a statistic which referenced one in 25,000 patients having Covid on 26th June has been removed and replaced, to state that 4.37 out of 100,000 hospital patients had Covid. Lines have also been added to explain that this number is likely higher than official statistics suggest.']"
Cyber-attack delays child's cancer operation,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv22yyljgw4o#1,Dylan Kjorstad's surgery was delayed due to concerns over blood supplies following a cyber-attack.,"Fri, 21 Jun 2024 16:15:21 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:25.170812,"['A 14-year-old boy with cancer is among hundreds of hospital patients whose medical procedures have been postponed following a cyber-attack on an NHS provider.Dylan Kjorstad was scheduled to have a tumour on his ribs removed on 6 June at London\'s Royal Brompton Hospital, but the operation has been put back due to concerns about delays in blood supplies.A ransomware attack on the blood-testing firm Synnovis on 3 June led to disruption to clinical procedures at several London hospitals because the hack meant the company was unable to share information matching blood supplies to patients.Dylan\'s father, John Kjorstad, told the BBC his son\'s condition was ""very serious"" said it would be ""dreadful"" if his chances of recovery were put at risk by the delay.', 'Dylan, from Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, was diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma - a type of bone cancer - in January.Since his diagnosis, Dylan has been undergoing two cycles of chemotherapy every month with the aim of shrinking the tumour ahead of surgery.But two days before the operation, Mr Kjorstad received a call from the Royal Brompton notifying him that surgery would have to be postponed.', '""It was one of those moments where you\'re trying to process what\'s being told to you. It was disbelief,"" he told the BBC.""It\'s such an important, major, surgery, and the person on the other end of the phone - who was very kind and polite - said the reason that it\'s been cancelled is because of an IT pathology issue.""The Royal Brompton Hospital has confirmed the surgery was postponed as a result of the cyber-attack. The operation has been rescheduled to early July, the trust said.""Our concern would be then if his surgery is postponed further. What will the  impact be on his treatment, and the tumour?

', 'Dr Chris Streather, medical director for NHS London, said the hack was ""continuing to have a significant impact"" on some NHS services. “Having treatment postponed is distressing for patients and their families, and I would like to apologise to any patient who has been impacted by the incident.""""Staff are continuing to work hard to re-arrange appointments and treatments as quickly as possible,"" he added.Overnight on Thursday, Qilin shared almost 400GB of the private information on their darknet site.Mr Kjorstad said he thought it was ""sad"" that vulnerable NHS patients were suffering as a result of the attack.""We\'re helpless against the perpetrators of these things because they sit in jurisdictions where normal law enforcement activity doesn\'t seem to be able to get to them.""And it\'s just really sad to me that it happens to to the most vulnerable people - the people who are seeking, and needing, healthcare.""NHS England said people should continue to attend appointments unless they are told otherwise.Extra reporting by Tara Mewawalla.', 'Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The breakthrough came from copying tissue structures in people, according to the team at Tokyo University. The prototype may appear more Haribo than human-like.But the researchers say it paves the way to making convincingly realistic, moving humanoids with self-healing skin that will not easily rip or tear. ', 'The artificial skin is made in the lab, using living cells.Not only is it soft, like real skin but it can repair itself if cut, the scientists say. Past attempts to attach it proved difficult, though. The team tried using mini hooks as anchors - but those damaged the skin as the robot moved. In people, the skin is tethered to underlying structures by ligaments - tiny ropes of flexible collagen and elastin. To recreate that, the researchers drilled lots of little holes into the robot and applied a gel containing collagen, and then the layer of artificial skin on top. The gel plugs the holes and tethers the skin to the robot.', '""By mimicking human skin-ligament structures and by using specially made V-shaped perforations in solid materials, we found a way to bind skin to complex structures,"" lead researcher Prof Shoji Takeuchi said.""The natural flexibility of the skin and the strong method of adhesion mean the skin can move with the mechanical components of the robot, without tearing or peeling away.""The latest results are published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science. It will take many more years of testing for the technology to become an everyday reality, the researchers say.""Another important challenge is creating human-like expressions by integrating sophisticated actuators, or muscles, inside the robot,"" Prof Takeuchi said. But the work may also be useful in research into skin ageing, cosmetics and surgical procedures, including plastic surgery.']"

World first epilepsy device fitted in UK boy's skull,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33kgd81mvo#1,"Oran, who is 13, was sometimes having hundreds of seizures a day due to his severe epilepsy.","Sun, 23 Jun 2024 23:05:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:25.171191,"['A boy with severe epilepsy has become the first patient in the world to trial a new device fitted in their skull to control seizures.The neurostimulator, which sends electrical signals deep into his brain, has reduced Oran Knowlson’s daytime seizures by 80%.His mother, Justine, told the BBC he was happier and had a “much better quality of life”.The surgery was carried out in October as part of a trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London when Oran - who is now 13 - was 12.', 'Oran, from Somerset, has Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a treatment-resistant form of epilepsy which he developed at the age of three.Since then he has suffered several daily seizures ranging from two dozen to hundreds.When we first spoke to Oran’s mum last autumn, prior to surgery, she explained how Oran’s epilepsy dominated his life: ""It has robbed him of all of his childhood."" She told us Oran had a range of different seizures, including those where he fell to the ground, shook violently, and lost consciousness.She said at times he would stop breathing and require emergency medication to resuscitate him.Oran is autistic and has ADHD, but Justine says his epilepsy is by far the biggest hurdle: ""I had a fairly bright three-year-old, and within a few months of his seizures commencing he deteriorated rapidly, and lost a lot of skills.""Oran is part of the CADET project - a series of trials assessing the safety and effectiveness of deep brain stimulation for severe epilepsy.The partnership involves Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London, King’s College Hospital and the University of Oxford.The Picostim neurotransmitter is made by UK company Amber Therapeutics.', 'Epilepsy seizures are triggered by abnormal bursts of electrical activity in the brain.The device, which emits a constant pulse of current, aims to block or disrupt the abnormal signals.Before the operation, Justine told us:  ""I want him to find some of himself again through the haze of seizures. I’d like to get my boy back.""The surgery, which lasted around eight hours, took place in October 2023.The team, led by consultant paediatric neurosurgeon Martin Tisdall, inserted two electrodes deep into Oran’s brain until they reached the thalamus, a key relay station for neuronal information.The margin of error for the lead placement was less than a millimetre.The ends of the leads were connected to the neurostimulator, a 3.5cm square and 0.6cm thick device which was placed in a gap in Oran’s skull where the bone had been removed.The neurostimulator was then screwed into the surrounding skull, to anchor it in place.', 'Deep brain stimulation has been tried before for childhood epilepsy, but until now neurostimulators were placed in the chest, with wires running up to the brain.Martin Tisdall told the BBC: ""This study is hopefully going to allow us to identify whether deep brain stimulation is an effective treatment for this severe type of epilepsy and is also looking at a new type of device, which is particularly useful in children because the implant is in the skull and not in the chest. ""We hope this will reduce the potential complications.""That includes reducing the risk of infections after the surgery, and the device failing. ', 'Oran was given a month to recover from the operation before the neurostimulator was turned on.When it is on, Oran cannot feel it. And he can recharge the device every day via wireless headphones, while getting on with things that he enjoys, like watching TV.We visited Oran and his family seven months post-op to see how they were getting on. Justine told us there had been a massive improvement in Oran\'s epilepsy: ""He is more alert and with no drop seizures during the day."" His night-time seizures are also ""shorter and less severe"".""I\'m definitely getting him back slowly,"" she said.Martin Tisdall said: ""We are delighted that Oran and his family have seen such a huge benefit from the treatment and that it has dramatically improved his seizures and quality of life.""Oran is now having riding lessons, which he clearly enjoys.Although a nurse is on hand with oxygen, and one of his teachers is always nearby just in case, neither has been needed so far.As part of the trial, three more children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome will be fitted with the deep brain neurostimulator.Currently, Oran gets a constant electrical stimulus from his device.', 'But in future, the team plan to make the neurostimulator respond in real time to changes in his brain activity, in an attempt to block seizures as they are about to happen.Justine said she was most excited about this next phase of the trial: ""The Great Ormond Street team gave us hope back…now the future looks brighter.""Oran’s family know his treatment is not a cure, but they are optimistic he will continue to emerge from the shadow cast by his epilepsy.The Picostim neurostimulator, owned by Amber Therapeutics, has also been used to treat patients with Parkinson’s disease.Another type of skull-mounted neurostimulator has been used in the United States to treat epilepsy.']"

Three legs, no tail. Piteous look on its face. No genitalia. It\'s there in my arms. And it was a life changing moment,” he later told Sheen.""I wanted to know who was responsible for this, what had caused it.  And I wanted those people to be held accountable.""', 'Douglas knew where to start.The farm was next to a landfill site, called Brofiscin Quarry.He collected samples from the water escaping the landfill and sent them to a laboratory, where scientists found a famous fire-retardant type of chemical called poly-chlorinated biphenyls - more commonly known as PCBs.PCBs are now known to be highly toxic and production of the chemicals is banned in 151 countries, including the UK.But back in the 1960s, the chemicals were celebrated and used in products like paint and paper to stop them from catching fire.The chemicals were largely associated with one company - a US chemical giant called Monsanto - whose European factory was in Newport, south Wales. The company is no longer in existence.The company had produced thousands of tonnes of surplus PCBs which were being buried in dumpsites.Douglas began to fear that the chemical was getting into the food chain - via fields, cattle, meat and milk.He also feared that PCBs were so-called forever chemicals, meaning they would never biodegrade.', ""Can we take the 'forever' out of forever chemicals?Where do 'forever chemicals' in drinking water come from?Listen: Inside Science - Forever chemicals"", ""Douglas was sure he was on to something and worked for years to prove it.But at the time there was disagreement, as the government's own tests from the site revealed lower levels of PCBs.Douglas, who died in 2018 at the age of 74, believed there was a conspiracy to silence him and spent a period of time in witness protection.Most of his key documents were never put into the public domain.After he died, his confidential documents ended up with an MP who agreed to share them with the hosts of a new podcast called Buried: The Last Witness on BBC Radio 4.Perhaps the biggest twist of the series is how Michael Sheen came to be involved."", '""I\'m just sitting in my house in LA, kind of going mad over the computer, thinking \'I\'ve stumbled across something\',"" Sheen told Dan and Lucy.""Well, not thinking I\'ve stumbled across something. Thinking, I\'m finding out about something that surely people must know about, because this is extraordinary.""Sheen tracked Douglas down in 2017 just a year before he died.The actor then spent a weekend with Douglas, during which he recorded his full story.""He seemed very into wanting to tell his story, and also I think it became clear he felt like he might not have long to tell it. ""I suppose, if anything, I was expecting a kind of anti-establishment, rebel, maverick, \'stick it to the man\' kind of bloke, and that is not at all what I found,"" said Sheen.Douglas, who returned to the south Wales farm to take multiple samples over the years, believed being exposed to PCBs had taken a toll on his health.""I\'ve got all sorts of problems. Of which… I think virtually all can be attributed to my exposure to PCBs,"" Douglas told Sheen in the recording.Douglas was angry, because he said PCBs had cost him and feared they would cost many others in the future.But he was angrier still that nobody did anything.The podcast\'s producer Dan Ashby said: ""Most true-crime series have a victim, who we all feel empathy for. ""But in this one, we know the poison, we know the culprits, but the scary question is this: are we all the victims? I\'ve never recorded an investigation that is at once so universal, and so deeply personal.""', 'All episodes of Buried: The Last Witness are available to listen to now on BBC Sounds.

""But UV is also dangerous because every exposure to UV, especially every sunburn, increases our risk of skin cancer.  ""Melanoma, the most dangerous skin cancer, is now the fifth commonest cancer in the UK, the ongoing rise being attributed to sunbathing,"" she said.UV radiation promotes skin cancer by damaging DNA in skin cells.It has also been linked to eye problems, including cataracts.And there is growing evidence that UV light may reduce the body\'s ability to defend itself against certain diseases.', 'Levels of UV radiation vary throughout the day.The highest readings occur in the four-hour period around ""solar noon"",  which is when the sun is at its highest spot in the sky - usually from late morning to early afternoon.The UV Index (or UVI) is a standard, international measure of ultraviolet radiation.Values start at zero and can rise above 10.The higher the number, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eyes - and the less time it takes for harm to occur.', 'Countries close to the equator can experience very high UV levels in the middle of the day, throughout the year.Nairobi in Kenya can have UV levels above 10 all year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Majorca in Spain, will normally hit nine in June and July.But the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic never usually gets above five in December and January (when it is summer in the southern hemisphere).', 'According to the WHO, extra sun protection is required when levels are: 11+ (extremely high) 8-10 (very high) Protection is required when levels are: 6-7 (high) 3-5 (medium)No protection is required when levels are: 1-2 (low)  ', 'There is no safe or healthy way to get a tan, the UK\'s national health service (NHS) says.

The milder one caused a global outbreak in 2022 which spread to nearly 100 countries that do not usually see the virus.The second, more deadly strain is endemic in central Africa - it is behind the new recently discovered strain in DR Congo.The two types carry different risks of disease and mortality.', 'Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles.Once the fever breaks, a rash can develop, often beginning on the face then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring.The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days.Serious cases can see lesions attack the whole of the body, and especially the mouth, eyes and genitals.', 'Mpox spreads from person to person through close contact with someone who is infected - including through sex, skin-to-skin contact and talking or breathing close to another person.The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth.It can also be spread through touching objects which have been contaminated by the virus, such as bedding, clothing and towels.Close contact with infected animals, such as monkeys, rats and squirrels, is another route. During the global outbreak in 2022, the virus spread mostly through sexual contact.The current DR Congo outbreak is being driven by sexual contact, but has also been found in other communities. ', 'Most cases are often found in people who are sexually active and men who have sex with men. People with several partners or new sexual partners can be most at risk.But anyone who has close contact with someone with symptoms can catch the virus, including health workers and family members.Advice is to avoid close contact with anyone with mpox and clean your hands with soap and water if the virus is in your community.Those who have mpox should isolate from others until all their lesions have disappeared.Condoms should be used as a precaution when having sex for 12 weeks after recovery, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.', 'A therapy designed to treat smallpox can also be useful for treating mpox, but there is limited research on how effective it is. Outbreaks of mpox can be controlled by preventing infections - the best way of doing that is with vaccines.There are three vaccines that exist but only people at risk or who have been in close contact with an infected person are usually able to have it.The WHO does not currently recommend vaccinating entire populations.Further trials of vaccines against new mpox strains are needed to understand how much protection they provide.']"

There has also been a rise among adults aged between 25 and 49, according to the charity's analysis.  For this group the rate has gone up from 14 to 15 per 100,000 people over 10 years. Young people are more likely to be aware of the link between UV and skin cancer than older generations, scientists suggest. This could mean they’re more likely to take precautions in the sun, compared with older people, who grew up when less was known about the dangers of tanning.Many people also took advantage of the cheap package-holiday boom, which began in the 1960s, researchers say.  "", 'Caroline Jones, 57, from Shrewsbury, was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2018 after spotting a tiny blemish on her leg.She told the BBC: ""It was tiny and shiny with a black bit in the middle. It just didn\'t look right. ""The scary thing is if it was on my back I probably wouldn\'t have seen it. But because I saw it and went quickly to the doctor, I\'m still here today.""Caroline\'s melanoma was caught early, and after surgery to remove it, she is now cancer-free. ""I’ve never been a sun-bather but each of the times I’ve been abroad I have burnt quite badly. ""That\'s probably five times of falling asleep in the sun for a few hours,"" she said. ""I hope my story will encourage people to think about their habits and take care when they’re enjoying the sun.""CRUK\'s chief executive, Michelle Mitchell, says survival from cancers including melanoma continues to improve, ""demonstrating the substantial progress made possible by research"".But it is vital that people try to reduce their risk of getting the disease in the first place, she adds. “Make sure to take care in the sun and contact your GP if you notice any unusual changes to your skin - whether a new or changing mole, a sore that doesn’t heal, or an area of your skin that looks out of the ordinary. ""Spotting cancer early can make all the difference.”Almost nine in 10 adults diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer in England will survive their disease for 10 years or more.', 'Spend time in the shade between 11am and 3pmNever burnCover up with suitable clothing (including a wide-brimmed hat and long-sleeved top) and sunglassesTake extra care with childrenUse at least factor-30 sunscreen regularly Source: NHS']"

""My feeling at the start of the day was just so gutted that Perry was missing it,"" she told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme.The government announced a wide-ranging compensation scheme for victims on Tuesday. Speaking after the announcement, Heather told the BBC: “I’m just glad they’ve announced something.”In particular, she said she was “hugely relieved” that people who lost children or parents to the scandal would receive compensation.A public inquiry found authorities had exposed victims to unacceptable risks and covered up the NHS\'s biggest treatment disaster.Some 30,000 people were infected. Perry is one of around 3,000 who have died so far. Sir Brian shared Perry\'s story as he delivered his findings on Monday.

""Why was this not announced a year ago?"" she asked ahead of the government\'s announcement on Tuesday.She was not the only one asking questions of the government. While some campaigners have praised the prime minister for apologising for the scandal on behalf of successive governments, others have criticised the government for waiting for the full report before setting up a full compensation scheme.Heather said the government had learned nothing it did not already know a year ago. ""And in that year, so many people have died. Including Perry.""', 'In 2022, an independent report by Sir Robert Francis recommended compensation for victims irrespective of the findings of the public inquiry. The UK government said at the time that it accepted the moral case for compensation and made payments of £100,000 to 4,000 people who had been infected.Sir Brian published an interim report into the scandal in April 2023. He recommended the government begin work on a compensation scheme that same year. Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson, a long time campaigner on the scandal, said the government\'s failure to provide compensation payments to victims following this interim report ""added another layer of hurt"".Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called for people to be prosecuted for their role in the scandal. The former health secretary told the BBC corporate manslaughter charges should be brought, and backed Sir Brian\'s calls for civil servants to be subject to a ""duty of candour"" law, which would force them to ""tell the truth at the first time of asking"". Mr Burnham said this is the ""only way to break the cycle"" that has led to successive public scandals.  ', 'Perry Evans met Heather in 1987, two years after he was diagnosed with HIV. He contracted the illness after he was given infected blood during treatment for haemophilia. ""We were told he had two or three years to live,"" said Heather. ""We were married for nearly 36 years.""The couple were also told they would never have children, but they have a son, Isaac, now 22, and a daughter, Cerian, now 19.""But there were huge difficulties along the way, huge health crises"", she explained. ""And that’s part of the shock that he has gone, because so many things he rose above – time after time after time. So we are still shocked that he’s gone.""Perry survived many complications stemming from infected blood. He outlived his original three-year HIV prognosis, only to be diagnosed with HIV-related cancer in 2002. He survived this illness only to fall into a coma, from which he was never expected to return, in 2008.Again, he survived, but he suffered from a range of health problems related to HIV and Hepatitis C for the rest of his life. ""He did his absolute best to give us the best time,"" said Heather. ""In the last three years we\'ve done some amazing things.""Perry was ""forever booking us really great concerts and gigs"", and the family went on ""the best holidays we could do in the circumstances"". Last November, Perry booked a wave of activities for Heather\'s birthday. ""We called it \'Showvember\',"" she said. Heather says her husband ""didn\'t really contemplate"" what his family would do after he died. ""We\'ve still got a ticket left for next April to see Peter Kay live,"" she said. ""I’m so proud that he saw our kids into adulthood and he saw our daughter get into theatre school,"" she said. ""He would want them to thrive and fly and absolutely fly. That’s his legacy.""']"

They don’t work and just stay at home.”A poster of the class sizes hanging on the wall of the headteacher’s office spells out the challenge schools like Chanyanya face.In one of the classrooms, 75 boys and 85 girls are squeezed into a space that would comfortably fit only 30 pupils.“When I started in 2019 I had about 40 students, but now it’s around 100 plus, and that is just in one class,” says 33-year-old teacher Cleopatra Zulu.“Each and every day we receive new learners because of free education. Talking one-on-one is difficult, even marking is a challenge. We have even reduced the number of subjects that we are giving them”.', 'The experience of pupil Richard Banda reflects this.“We don’t learn in the same way as those times when we used to pay, there’s a little bit of a difference,” he tells the BBC.“When we were few the teacher would explain a topic again if you didn’t understand, but now because we are many, the teacher doesn’t repeat it again. That’s the difference.”The uptick in the number of learners is reflected across sub-Saharan Africa with more children in school than ever before, the UN children’s agency Unicef says.But with nine out of 10 primary school students in the region still struggling to read and understand simple texts, according to Unicef, the focus for policy-makers is now shifting to the quality of the education, the hiring of qualified teachers and the physical infrastructure and resources.“When you don’t sit properly in a classroom, that affects the way that you pay attention to teaching, the way that you write your notes,"" says Aaron Chansa, the director of the National Action of Quality Education in Zambia (NAQEZ), which the government consults.""We are seeing learners getting into secondary school when they can’t read properly,"" he says, adding that there are problems across the country.“In Eastern Province we have more than 100 learners in one class. This has also worsened the book-to-pupil ratio. In some instances you find one book being fought over by six or seven learners.”The government says it is listening and taking steps to address the challenges created by making education free.“This is a good problem,” says Education Minister Douglas Syakalima. “I’d rather let the children be in a congested classroom than in the street.""“The president launched mass production of desks, mass infrastructure-building is happening.”', 'Zambia has invested over $1bn (£784m) in the education sector since the introduction of free education three years ago - a much-needed boost after years of decline in spending as a proportion of GDP in this sector.The government has announced plans to build over 170 new schools and has committed to the recruitment of 55,000 new teachers by the end of 2026, of whom 37,000 have already been hired.The move has provided fresh job opportunities, but it has also led to a shortage of accommodation in rural areas. Some teachers are reporting having to live in grass-thatched houses and share pit latrines, which are at risk of overflowing.“When it’s the rainy season here, you don’t really want to visit us,” says Ms Zulu, who lives in the school compound and remembers being nervous about the risk of cholera during the outbreak earlier this year.Just outside her house, a large patch of dried-up shower gel marks the spot where one of the residents bathed earlier, in the open, with privacy provided only by the darkness before sunrise.“The houses we live in are more like a death-trap,” says Ms Zulu. “The government should do something about the houses, especially the toilets.”', 'Worried about learning outcomes, some families have quietly begun to take action.Robert Mwape is a taxi driver based in Lusaka.In 2022, he moved his 11-year-old son from a private, fee-paying school to a public one to take advantage of free education, but he soon came to regret the move.“I noticed [my son’s] results began going down. So one day I decided to visit the classroom. There were too many of them. You know what young people are like - so many of them, they waste time talking. The teacher couldn’t focus the entire class.”The following year Mr Mwape, who did not want us to use his real name, reversed his original decision. Now aged 13, his son is back at a private school.With Zambia slowly emerging from a debt default in 2020, some experts have cast doubt over the sustainability of the free education policy.A 2023 report from the Zambia Institute for Policy Analysis and Research says that if all eligible students take up the offer of free education, government expenditure is estimated to double, “raising questions on the commitment of subsequent governments to continue the policy”.But the education minister says he is confident the administration can shoulder the cost.“I don’t see [the challenge] myself. Education is the best economic policy, ” says Mr Syakalima.Making school free is widely seen as a first step towards giving young Zambians a fair chance to a brighter future.But the country’s experience so far shows the challenges of managing a growing number of students while trying to maintain the quality of the education they receive.', ""Zambia cholera: Families grieve as infection kills loved onesWhy free schools have not solved Kenya's problemsZimbabwe education: Parents of school dropouts face jail"", 'Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica']"

This is part of a programme that’s nurturing her ambition to study medicine at university in 2033.That might sound improbable, to dream so far ahead, but there is good reason for this group existing: while record numbers of young people are going to university, in this part of Newcastle only 15% to 20% of young people go on to study for a degree.The children at these sessions are drawn from schools where more than half of the pupils qualify for free school meals, so the family’s total income is below £7,400.Studying for a degree will mean loans not just for tuition fees but for living costs, because for these future students there is no bank of mum and dad.Some will reduce their living costs by studying locally and continuing to live at home.', 'But now universities are warning of financial failures being just around the corner and the fear is that among the more vulnerable could be some universities with a higher number of students living with their parents.If that happens, it is future students from communities like this across England who have most to lose. The former universities minister Jo Johnson has described universities as the only worthwhile levelling-up policy but now there are warnings that several institutions could be close to going bust.To make sense of what might happen now, you need to go back almost 25 years to when the then-Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair set out an ambition for half of young people to go to university.  Talent, he declared, was 21st Century wealth and there was no reason to limit the numbers studying for a degree.The £9,000 fees introduced in 2012 led to a boom in England’s universities, not least in new buildings on campuses eager to attract students from home and abroad. The limit on the number of students universities could recruit was also lifted.How much does uni in the UK cost and will I earn more if I go?Student finance 2024: How do UK student loans work?The bubble now feels close to bursting, tuition fees have been frozen and so not kept pace with inflation and dozens of institutions are closing academic posts and merging courses to cut spending.Meanwhile, students say the total cost of studying for a degree is too much as living costs have soared.A financial crisis at a university requiring a bailout is said to be on the disaster list drawn up Sue Gray, chief of staff to Labour leader Keir Starmer, of things that could potentially go wrong for a new administration.Whoever forms the next government, there are decisions ahead that can’t be dodged, and none of them are easy because universities in England would have an enormous impact if any were to fail but equally would be costly to bail out.Molly Smith is the first in her family to go to university and says she wouldn’t have gone away to study for a degree.She still lives at home in Newcastle so she can afford her course in International Studies and Politics at the University of Northumbria. More than half the students here are from the north-east England and many live at home.', 'Molly doesn’t think the £9,250 tuition fees can go up any further,  because university overall feels expensive to her.She describes her university experience as “amazing and brilliant” because it has widened her horizons and she says most students think more about the immediate cost of living than the cost of tuition.“I think if maintenance loans did increase as well as tuition fees, I think more people would focus on the maintenance. It would be more of an incentive to go to university.”Molly thinks anyone who wants to and can should be able to study for a degree and she has strong views about the importance of having universities on the doorstep that go beyond the issue of being able to avoid paying rent.“From being being born and raised in the north it’s important to avoid a brain drain of people with these skills, all migrating to the south,” she says.She wants to work as a civil servant in a big government department.In some ways Molly is lucky. She’s in her second year so will repay her student loans for up to 30 years out of her graduate earnings, with the bill for any left unpaid picked up out of public money.It’s different for those who started at university this year in England who will be expected to repay for up 40 years, potentially until their early 60s.This change, and a recent change to interest rates, means future graduates in England will be responsible for 84% of the total cost of their university education, according to very recent research.Hold on to that figure because it has implications for what a future government can do.The new repayment terms also mean lower-earning graduates,  including teachers and nurses, will end up repaying more than a banker or a lawyer, because they will repay for longer with loans attracting more interest.In Scotland there are no tuition fees, and in Wales and Northern Ireland the cost is now split more evenly between future graduates and government funding, according to recent research.With all of this going on, what has it meant for how many young people go to university?The participation rate in the north-east of England is 30% compared with 50% in London. Across England around 60% of the most advantaged study for a degree, compared with closer to 15% of the least advantaged.', 'That’s why the centre in east Newcastle has become one of the more recent additions to a network run by Into University, which supports children from age seven to 18.Through after-school study and mentoring, the charity aims to encourage more confidence among children of all abilities.In Newcastle on the day I visited, the primary-aged children were looking at some simple concepts in economics such as supply and demand, as well as practising maths skills.Throughout this term their study sessions are linked to a potential future degree subject, Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE).Anna, age 10, wasn’t sure exactly what she wants to do when she grows up, apart from working with animals.""I would like to go to university. I think it would be fun to... spend time somewhere else.""Family income is clearly one big factor in who goes to university.Young people from the wealthiest families across England are 11 times more likely to enter a university requiring high entry grades, the most academically selective,  than those from the most disadvantaged.So when anyone says too many young people go to university,  whose children are they talking about?What is noticeable at this voluntary session is that most of the children are from black or Asian British backgrounds. Only a minority are white.', 'And when you look at pupils that are from the very lowest-income families, who have received free school meals, there are some quite marked and surprising differences.In this group just 13% of white boys go on to university compared with more than 60% of Black or Asian children.The north-east of England has five universities, each a major employer in their own area, an important part of the economy.One in four of the students in the region end up at the University of Northumbria, and one in five live at home.“They need our university to be successful and importantly they need us to offer a wide range of subjects,” argues Professor Andy Long, so that students like Molly do not feel forced to go further afield or not study for a degree at all.The university has plans to find more than £12m of savings, to keep ahead of future challenges, and maintain financial stability.It is in the top 10 universities in England for recruiting international students from the burgeoning middle classes in both India and Nigeria.This exposes them to more volatile circumstances beyond their control.International recruitment is down across England, since a rule-change in January stopped international students bringing their spouse or children. A currency devaluation in Nigeria has also made a UK degree less affordable.Since tuition fees of £9,000 were introduced in 2012, they have increased by just £250. To compensate, universities have become more reliant on attracting international students, mainly for postgraduate study.Prof Long describes the current funding system as “broken” and also accepts the idea of increasing tuition fees is politically toxic.While he wants any future government to look at options for increasing funding, he argues support for students living costs is also an urgent priority.Maintenance grants were abolished in England, replaced with loans from 2016.While the minimum student income needed to live on is estimated in recent research to be £18,000, the maximum loan is around £10,000.“So what you end up with now is students from the poorest backgrounds leaving university with the highest level of debt and working the most hours part time while they’re at university. I think that’s a scandal,” says Prof Long.', 'In England there has been a stark warning that 40% of higher education institutions are predicting a deficit from the regulator.“There are several institutions that are teetering on the brink of going bust,” says Dr Gavan Conlon from London Economics.He’s a leading expert in the economics of university education and this year has published research funded by the Nuffield Foundation to inform future government decisions.He says no new government would allow a university to collapse because, as major employers, it would be “catastrophic for the local community” - which could mean finding many tens of millions of pounds of public money for an immediate bailout.Dr Conlon also thinks increasing support for student living costs through existing loans or grants has to be looked at as part of thinking in the round about how to pay for university education.Many of the options are politically tricky, given the huge student protests that greeted the introduction of £9,000 fees in 2012.Tuition fees in England are frozen at £9,250 for the next year. After that, whoever is in government will have to decide whether to increase them or give public money upfront to universities to support teaching costs.And remember,  England has now loaded 84% of the total cost of studying for a degree onto future graduates, so it’s hard to shift the balance further.The future bill to the public purse of writing off unpaid loans, called the RAB charge, is now estimated at only 4% in England.A future government might look at tweaking the interest rates to ensure higher, not lower-earning graduates pay a bigger share.One other idea that has some support is that of a graduate levy for employers, who benefit from the additional skills in their workforce, which Dr Conlon says could generate “huge” amounts of money.It’s not clear how that would work for big public sector employers like the NHS.The number of international students could be allowed to grow further, but that brings greater uncertainty because of factors outside universities’ control.Ultimately this is about political choices.The money either has to come direct from government, from future graduates or from other forms of taxation such as the proposed graduate levy on employers.Given the size of universities, their importance in some regions and the state of their finances, some decisions will have to be made in the next parliament.It may be that universities are deemed too big to be allowed to fail, especially where they are a big part of their local economy.The big expansion of the last decade also means more students, graduates and their families than ever before have a stake in their future.The less academically selective universities take on the majority of students from poorer backgrounds, offering social mobility and the potential of higher earnings.In the last decade, researchers have been linking big data of everyone taking GCSEs in England from 2002 onwards, with student and then tax records, giving an insight into the economic benefits of degrees.For women graduates, compared with non-graduates, this data is unambiguous. Based on their earnings at 30, it pays to go to university. For men the difference is slightly smaller because of better-paid non-graduate work.On average university pays,  although not all benefit equally, and a not insignificant minority don’t gain financially and might do better just on this measure going through a technical or vocational route.There has been a great social experiment playing out through the expansion of England’s universities, with no limit on student numbers.So far only the Greens have called for tuition fees to be abolished. They also want to bring back maintenance grants and look in the longer term at reducing existing graduate debt.As tuition fees are the major source of income for universities in England, that would have to be replaced with public money.Labour has confirmed it won’t scrap tuition fees and has said the funding model isn’t working.The Lib Dems have promised to review higher education funding and to reinstate maintenance grants for disadvantaged students immediately.The Conservative manifesto does not mention tuition fees directly, but it does say courses with the worst outcomes would be closed.In its manifesto which it calls a contract, Reform says it would extend the repayment on the capital of student loans to 45 years, while scrapping interest. It also wants to limit the number of undergraduates and require minimum entry standards for all university courses.Whoever forms the next government, they will have to decide whether or not they are willing to let universities shrink, packing in students to ever bigger classes, or even fail completely.', 'BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Would Labour’s private school tax plan work?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ddvv7vnygo#2,A teacher and former policy adviser at the Department for Education discuss Labour’s proposed policy.,"Sat, 22 Jun 2024 00:13:17 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:29.572227,"['The Labour Party has pledged to add tax to private schools fees and use the funds to recruit teachers for state schools.The policy, proposed in Labour’s manifesto, has split opinion. Some argue it is a reasonable way to raise revenue and others think it’s an unfair charge that will fall on parents.The BBC’s Sarah Montague spoke with Sam Freedman, former adviser to the former Education Secretary Michael Gove, who is in favour of the proposed VAT charge, and Kristina Murkett, an English teacher at a private school, who is against. Their conversation was first broadcast on Monday 17 June on BBC Radio 4’s World At One.', 'One of the Labour Party’s few clear money raising policies in their manifesto is to impose VAT on private school fees. They reckon they can raise £1.5 billion to train 6,500 more teachers.It’s a policy that polls well. Perhaps not surprising given that only around 7% of all students go to private school. Although that figure rises to 17% of all sixth formers, according to University College London.Given Labour’s huge lead in the polls it could mean 20% added to school fees. So what would the consequences of that be?', ""My fear is that this is not the sort of easy win for social mobility that Labour are kind of portraying it to be, and there's a couple of reasons for that.I mean, lots has been talked about in the press about how this is going to disproportionately affect more middle-class parents who already feel the squeeze to send their kids to private schools. This is also going to potentially disproportionately affect smaller, less wealthy independent schools, particularly those who perhaps can't afford to offset the VAT costs.I’m worried about the kind of exodus to the state sector that this may cause, and that the average amount raised per pupil in terms of VAT is predicted to be about £3,000, which is less than half of what will be needed to educate them in the state sector."", ""I just worry as well that schools won’t feel as motivated to stick to their charitable status. I think there’s been lots of really, really positive progress over recent years in terms of the number of bursaries and means-tested scholarships that private schools are offering.And I think a much more interesting or nuanced policy from Labour would be to hold private schools to that charitable status. And perhaps, instead of charging VAT, say okay, 20% of your revenue costs need to go towards bursaries and scholarships.I think we should be trying to make these schools more affordable and more accessible.Further context: The Labour Party manifesto pledges to end private schools' VAT exemption and business rate relief. It does not say it will remove their charitable status."", 'Because we need some money. The Labour Party have ruled out a lot of tax increases.We have major, major holes in most public sectors — health, education, criminal justice.This is one of the places they\'ve said they\'re willing to get money from, and it\'s a pretty reasonable source given the vast majority of people who use private schools are in the top 10% of most wealthy households. Indeed, most are in the top 1% or 2% of the most wealthy households. So it is a tax that disproportionately affects the people who can pay it the most.Unlike others I\'m not worried about some kind of exodus to the state sector. Demand for private schools is incredibly inelastic. The numbers going to private schools have not changed in decades, despite big inflationary increases in fees.Further context: Data from University College London published in 2021 showed: ""The proportion of children attending private school is close to zero across the vast majority of the income distribution, and doesn’t rise above 10% of the cohort except among those with the top 5% of incomes. Only half of those in the top 1% send their kids to private school.”', 'It is a problem if there is an exodus? Because obviously you’re collecting less in VAT and you’re also having to fund the cost of paying for that child in the state sector.', ""It’s actually not that much of a problem for two reasons.Firstly, because in the state sector rolls are falling by a lot more than the potential number of children that might come from the private sector, even in the most extreme possible scenarios.The second point is yes, they wouldn't be paying VAT on school fees. But people who use the state sector instead would have a lot of other money available for other things like holidays and cars and so on and those things all have VAT charged on them.Further context:  The Institute for Fiscal Studies said: “If parents stop spending £15,000 on private school fees because of the increase in VAT, they are likely to spend the money on other goods and services at some point in time, generating extra VAT revenues”. However, this is not guaranteed as parents could choose to save the money."", 'Kristina, I know you work at a private school. Do you know of parents who would pull their children out?', 'Absolutely, yes. I mean, obviously there are kids who come from incredibly wealthy parents at my school, but there are a lot of kids whose parents are university staff and academics, and there\'s a lot of kids whose parents are doctors.I think the demographic of people that are going to private schools is changing. I think there\'s a lot of international demand that is kind of maintaining that.I think the exodus is going to be a bigger problem than we realise. Because, on the one hand, I understand that lots of parents may not pull their kids out immediately. Particularly, let\'s say, if they’re in the middle of year 10, in the middle of GCSEs for example.But I think there are a lot of parents who will be kind of thinking “Oh, actually, I\'m not sure I am going to send my kids to private school if there is a 20% increase in fees"" and all that does is push the house prices up next to those really attractive state schools.I don’t think this is the easy win for social mobility that it is perhaps being portrayed as.', ""By the time students are in sixth form post 16, it's something like 17%, possibly higher, of that age group are in the private sector. And that could create some problems for the state sector, couldn't it?"", ""It’s 17% of people doing A levels. But of course, only 40% of young people do A levels.I don't think it's going to be a big problem. You might have small parts of the country which have a lot of private schools, like Surrey or Kensington, where if you've got a couple of private school closures you might see a bit of pressure on some local schools. But it's very marginal.The state sector absorbed 20,000 Ukrainian refugee children in a year without any problem at all. The state sector is so much bigger than the private sector at absorbing a small number of children coming across. It really shouldn't be a problem."", ""Kristina, there has been a phenomenal increase in fees in recent years, up by, I think, 24% above inflation just in the last decade. And that hasn't seen numbers reduced."", ""No, it hasn't. And I think partly that is because of demand internationally.Anecdotally, I'm amazed - for example - when I'm doing 11-plus interviews how many kids I'm interviewing who are living abroad, living in Hong Kong, whose parents are willing to move over specifically to send their child to [a private] school because of the reputation.Part of it as well will be because it depends on where you're living, and I think the state sector is a real postcode lottery. Obviously there are some amazing state schools out there who are doing phenomenal things despite very difficult circumstances.But there are also a lot of schools who are really struggling. And therefore some parents feel, especially if their child's got special educational needs or perhaps is really bright and gifted and talented, they will try and do everything to send their child to that [private] school and they will make huge sacrifices to do so."", 'Sam, on that question of special educational needs. There are an increasing number of children who appear to have special educational needs and it takes time to get the educational health care plan.', ""Labour's policy does say that for children who do have an education and health care plan, they won't charge VAT on those places. So special needs schools should be fine.I think where you've got parents who have a justifiable claim for an education healthcare plan but haven’t yet claimed for it who were in the independent sector, there's an argument for fast tracking those students. So I think this is probably an area of the policy that does need to be a bit nuanced.But, of course, there are far, far more children with special needs in the state sector. And that's why we desperately need this money to support those young people, because we have huge deficits on special needs at the moment."", 'Further context:  Keir Starmer has confirmed that children with legally-binding education health care plans (EHCPs) who are in fee-paying schools because of a shortage of provision in the state sector would be exempt from the VAT increase.However, former Conservative education minister Claire Coutinho said Labour had “no plans” for the thousands of SEND children without EHCPs who are currently taught in private schools.', ""Sam, do you feel a bit uncomfortable about the fact that, in one sense, it's clobbering excellence?"", ""Well, I don’t think it is. That suggests the state system isn't excellent, and it is. There are loads of brilliant state schools.

That's why I want the money!It just seems bizarre to me that we say we're allowing a very rich cohort to go to these palaces, and it would therefore be incredibly iniquitous and unfair to tax them a bit more so that we can allow facilities like that for the 93% of children going to state school."", 'Produced by Rosemary McCabe, Text Formats Designs by Lou HunterTop image credit Getty Images']"
How will the government change the way private school fees are taxed?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c033dp0z1edo#2,The Kings Speech confirmed that the government will change the way private school fees are taxed.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 14:38:33 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:29.572347,"[""The Labour government has confirmed it will act on its manifesto commitment to change the way private school fees are taxed. The King's Speech included plans to remove the current exemption from value added tax (VAT), which the government says will fund 6,500 new teachers in England. "", 'Private schools, sometimes called independent schools, charge fees to most of their students.While some famous schools like Eton and Harrow charge about £50,000 a year, the average across the UK is about £15,000.There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England. Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, so do not have to follow the national curriculum, for example.Some local authorities pay for children with special educational needs and disabilities to attend private schools.', ""Value added tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy many goods or services in the UK. The standard rate is 20%.At the moment, private schools do not have to charge VAT on their fees because of a legal exemption for organisations providing education. About half of England's private schools are also charities, so receive an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes)."", ""The Labour manifesto pledged to end private schools' VAT exemption and business rate relief, rather than to remove their charitable status.The King's Speech confirmed that measures will be brought forward to remove the VAT exemption. It said this would fund 6,500 new teachers in England. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank previously calculated that the policy would raise about £1.6bn per year. It said this would generate an extra £1.3-1.5bn, after taking into account the estimated cost of accommodating children who might switch from private to state education as a result of the changes. That could allow a 2% increase in state school spending in England.The removal of the VAT exemption would be UK-wide, but education is devolved, so each nation's government would decide how to spend the additional money.Before the general election, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also confirmed that children with legally-binding education health care plans (EHCPs) who are in fee-paying schools because of a shortage of provision in the state sector would be exempt from the VAT increase.However, former Conservative education minister Claire Coutinho said Labour had “no plans” for the thousands of children with Send who do not have EHCPs but are currently taught in the private sector."", 'Removing the exemption does not necessarily mean fees would go up by 20%.The IFS points out that losing the exemption would mean that schools would be able to deduct the VAT they currently pay when buying goods and services. They could use these savings to subsidise fee increases. All private schools are different, and some may decide to put up their fees more than others. It is likely that private school attendance would fall as a result of the change, but it is difficult to know by how much.The average cost of private school fees has risen by 20% in real terms since 2010, and by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the IFS says. However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.The IFS suggests there could be a small initial drop-off in numbers.Over a longer period, though, it estimates private school attendance could fall by between 3% and 7%, or 20,000 to 40,000 pupils. This represents a small share of the total pupil population, which is more than nine million in England alone.  However, the impact on private school attendance is unlikely to be spread evenly, with a steeper fall in some schools than others.The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, believes the policy may see the closure of smaller institutions, which ""operate on tight margins"". It also warned that the policy could make private schools ""more exclusive"", cutting their number of fee-reducing bursaries.', 'During the general election campaign, Sir Keir and the new Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson both denied the policy would increase class sizes in state schools. Their colleague Emily Thornberry had suggested that could be necessary in the short-term.They point to IFS research which says it would be possible for the state sector to ""easily accommodate extra pupils"", because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 between now and 2030. That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools. However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some state schools could face pressure on class sizes.Teaching unions have already warned of a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, driven by concerns over pay and workload.The ISC says private schools are currently ""filling in gaps in state provision"" which is ""under an awful lot of pressure"".']"
New tech aims to keep polar bears and people apart,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cljy48yj99wo#0,Fears about the two species coming into contact are growing as Arctic sea ice melts.,"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 23:40:43 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.105689,"[""At the end of the Canadian Arctic summer, polar bears head inland to wait for the ice to form.   And while thousands of tourists  flock to catch a glimpse of these magnificent predators, researchers are developing novel ways to keep people and bears safely separated.  New tracking devices that stick in polar bears’ fur could be the key to protecting both people and bears - by closely monitoring the animals' locations.Polar bears now spend more of the year on land, as Arctic sea ice melts, so conservationists are increasingly concerned about bears and people coming into contact.The tracking tags, which have been tested on bears in Canadian Arctic, could help prevent those encounters, by “keeping a remote eye” on the bears."", 'Lead researcher Tyler Ross, a PhD candidate from York University in Toronto, said the fur tags were “particularly promising” for the prevention of these “human-bear interactions”.In communities in the southern Canadian Arctic, where the scientists tested these tags, polar bears that wander too close to a community are sometimes caught, transported and released in carefully selected sites away from towns and villages. “These tags could be fitted to those bears to monitor where they are after they\'ve been released,” explained Mr Ross.“If they\'re coming back towards the community, conservation staff would have a sense of where they are, and they could head them off. I think that\'s where they offer considerable promise.""The researcher, who studies polar bear ecology, also says the tags could fill important gaps in knowledge about the bears. And as the Arctic climate warms up rapidly, the need to monitor bears becomes increasingly urgent.', ""“There's a dearth of information about male polar bear movements, because they can't be equipped with conventional tracking collars,” said Mr Ross.The sea ice [that the polar bears use as a platform from which to hunt] is disappearing faster than it has in the past,” explained Mr Ross. “So the winter hunting season is getting shorter. We want to know where they're moving in response.”Polar bears are difficult to tag. Male bears’ heads are smaller than their necks, so tracking collars can just slip off.Another option is ear tags - attached by piercing the bear’s ear. They require an animal to be recaptured in order to remove the tag and, in rare cases, can injure the ear.The three new tags the researchers tested were designed by the company 3M in collaboration with the charity Polar Bears International. They all attach to the bears’ coarse fur.To fit the tags, scientists had to locate and sedate bears. They then assessed the quality of the data they received from each device and noted when the tags fell off."", 'The best performing device was called a SeaTrkr tag, which is “crimped” into the bears’ fur. It stayed attached for an average of 58 days and  - with an in-built GPS system - allowed the scientists to pinpoint the bears’ location to within just a few metres.“It’s ideal to have something that falls off naturally - that’s not permanently  attached to the bear,” explained Mr Ross. “But anything that lasts in the order of a few months would be great [for our research], because then you’re getting these important seasons that the bears are going through throughout the year.”Climate change is bringing bears and humans into closer proximity, making places where polar bears and people coexist, riskier for both.One  US Geological Survey study in 2022 that that used data from satellite tracking collars on more than 400 polar bears in Alaska, shows the time they spend onshore has grown significantly in recent decades.“Getting a better sense of polar bears’ movements is really crucial,” Mr Ross commented. “Particularly given the state of their environment at this point.”This study of the bear tags is published in the journal Animal Biotelemetry.

Secret 'sky island' rainforest saved by new discoveries,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51ylgr1zpxo#0,Dozens of unique animal and insect finds have helped secure protection for an unspoilt mountain forest.,"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 23:29:02 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.105902,"['Perched on a remote mountain top and surrounded by lowlands, Mabu is what\'s known as a ""sky island"" and is the largest rainforest in southern Africa. BBC environment correspondent Jonah Fisher went to Mabu with a team of scientists who have discovered dozens of new species there, helping to convince Mozambique to protect it.', '“Let me get my magic spoon,” Dr Gimo Daniel says with a smile.It’s hard to imagine anyone taking more delight in their work than the 36-year-old Mozambican beetle expert.We’re crouched around a small hole in the dirt not far from our camp in the centre of Mabu forest. Dr Daniel’s mission, like that of almost everyone on our expedition, is to find things that science has not seen before.Dung beetles are Dr Daniel’s speciality and he chuckles as he pulls out a big plastic tub of bait - his own faeces.', 'The smell is as you’d expect. Pungent and impossible to ignore.Dr Daniel tells me that he has already discovered what he believes are 15 new species of dung beetles.“They can smell it up to 50 metres from here, so they come as fast as they can,” he says. “It’s brunch.”', ""Twenty years ago, Mabu was a secret to all but the locals.It was 'discovered' for the outside world by Prof Julian Bayliss in 2004. An explorer and ecologist who now lives in north Wales, he was surveying satellite images of northern Mozambique when he came across a previously unknown dark green patch.A first expedition the following year confirmed that although locals had been hunting in the forest it was in incredibly good condition and its size at 75 square kilometres made Mabu the largest single block of rainforest in southern Africa.“I was like – oh my God – this is phenomenal,” Prof Bayliss recalls."", ""In early expeditions to Mabu, one of which I joined in 2009 while working as a BBC correspondent in southern Africa, Prof Bayliss was at the forefront of a 'gold rush' of discoveries, quickly finding several new species of chameleon, snake and butterfly.\u202f In all Prof Bayliss says they’ve found at least 25 new species, and that's not even counting the dung beetles, many of which still need to be officially recognised.What makes Mabu so special is its geography. A medium altitude rainforest, it protrudes above Mozambique’s lowlands, makes it effectively a 'sky island'.That means most of the animals and insects that live there have no way of meeting and breeding with other populations, increasing the chances of them evolving in isolation into something unique and new to science."", ""The expedition the BBC joined this year at Prof Bayliss' invitation was the first time a team of scientists had based themselves right in the centre of the forest.Mabu was in part protected by Mozambique’s long history of civil war, the longest of which ended in 1992. It was also helped by the fact that it’s just so hard to get there. After driving five hours along dirt roads all of the camping gear, food and equipment is loaded on to the backs and heads of more than sixty porters.While we, and the scientists, adjusted our walking boots and dropped hydration salts in our water bottles, the porters, many of them wearing just flipflops, marched up Mount Mabu’s steep slopes."", 'One of the first to find something new is Erica Tovela, a freshwater fish expert from Mozambique’s Natural History Museum. In the stream that runs through camp she catches a type of small catfish she’s not seen before.“I hope that we have a new species for this area,” she says with a smile as she holds up a see-through bag of dead fish. (They will be preserved in formaldehyde for further analysis and comparison with other similar species.) “Amazing. It will be the first new species for me.”The process of definitively identifying a new species can take years. It involves writing a peer-reviewed paper in a journal in which the differences between the new discovery and its closest relatives are outlined and accepted by other scientists.The next step for Ms Tovela is to get the DNA of her fish analysed and detailed descriptions and images circulated. And what might be the name?“It should be something\u202fmabuensis,” she says. “It’s a nice way of saying we have one specific species that’s from Mabu.”', ""Mabu’s forest is in good condition but that’s not to say that some things haven’t changed.The large mammals that once inhabited it like lions, rhinos and buffalos have all been hunted out, most likely for food during the war. Deforestation has also taken a toll, though not as badly as other forests in southern Africa.“It's very visible that forests (in southern Africa) that I've been to just 15 to 20 years ago have now disappeared, cut down for many different reasons,” says Prof Ara Monadjem, an expert in small mammals from the University of Eswatini, who was on the trip.At Mabu the deforestation has so far been limited but locals are certainly hunting. Camera traps show hunters carrying animals they’ve caught and we see physical traps made from car springs set just off the tracks through the forest. But at the same time species of smaller mammals are also being discovered. They included a horseshoe bat called\u202fRhinolophus mabuensis\u202fand a dwarf musk shrew which scientists are still in the process of naming and describing."", 'Not everyone on the expedition is looking for new species. Bird experts Claire Spottiswoode and Callan Cohen have a very specific mission. To find evidence that one of Africa’s rarest birds is still alive.The Namuli apalis only lives at altitude and there are fears that a combination of the destruction of forest elsewhere and warming temperatures are pushing the small yellow and black bird towards extinction.', '“Climate change often has these effects that are hard to predict,” Callan Cohen explains pointing out that sometimes warmer temperatures encourage snake activity, which means more nests and chicks come under attack.Trying to find the rare bird involves playing it a recording of a Namuli apalis through a Bluetooth speaker and then waiting to see if any respond.', ""There’s no sign or sound on the day that we join the search, but several days later the bird experts return to camp late at night bringing with them good news.They managed to record sound of the Namuli Apalis on one of the higher ridges.“It's\u202fstill\u202fa little concerning, to be honest,” Dr Cohen says of the huge effort it had taken."", ""So what happens next? For Mabu, at least the signs appear positive.Pejul Calenga, the director general of Mozambique's conservation areas, tells me in an interview that Mabu is to be turned into a community protected area.That will mean no logging or mining is allowed but that the locals who depend on the forest for their livelihoods will manage and be able to use it.Of the role played by the scientists' work in getting the area protected, he says: “It's much easier to stand up for those areas in which we have unique resources present.” Mr Calenga said Mabu now forms part of Mozambique’s commitment to a global biodiversity pledge to protect 30 percent of its land by 2030. Having led so many expeditions into Mabu forest Prof Bayliss is cautiously optimistic that if the management plan is done well Mabu will turn into a conservation success story.He is already looking elsewhere in Africa for other sites that need protection.""]"
Cave discovered on Moon could be home for humans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce784r9njz0o#0,It is the first cave to be discovered on the Moon and could protect astronauts from radiation.,"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 15:00:36 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.106094,"['Scientists have for the first time discovered a cave on the Moon.At least 100m deep, it could be an ideal place for humans to build a permanent base, they say.It is just one in probably hundreds of caves hidden in an “underground, undiscovered world”, according to the researchers.Countries are racing to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon, but they will need to protect astronauts from radiation, extreme temperatures, and space weather.Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut to travel to space, told BBC News that the newly-discovered cave looked like a good place for a base, and suggested humans could potentially be living in lunar pits in 20-30 years.But, she said, this cave is so deep that astronauts might need to abseil in and use “jet packs or a lift” to get out.Lorenzo Bruzzone and Leonardo Carrer at the University of Trento in Italy found the cave by using radar to penetrate the opening of a pit on a rocky plain called the Mare Tranquillitatis.It is visible to the naked eye from Earth, and is also where Apollo 11 landed in 1969.The cave has a skylight on the Moon’s surface, leading down to vertical and overhanging walls, and a sloping floor that might extend further underground.It was made millions or billions of years ago when lava flowed on the Moon, creating a tunnel through the rock.The closest equivalent on Earth would be the volcanic caves in Lanzarote, Spain, Prof Carrer explains, adding that the researchers visited those caves as part of their work.', '“It’s really exciting. When you make these discoveries and you look at these images, you realise you’re the first person in the history of humanity to see it,” Prof Carrer said.Once Prof Bruzzone and Prof Carrer understood how big the cave was, they realised it could be a good spot for a lunar base. “After all, life on Earth began in caves, so it makes sense that humans could live inside them on the Moon,” says Prof Carrer.The cave has yet to be fully explored, but the researchers hope that ground-penetrating radar, cameras or even robots could be used to map it.Scientists first realised there were probably caves on the Moon around 50 years ago. Then in 2010 a camera on a mission called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter took pictures of pits that scientists thought could be cave entrances.But researchers did not know how deep the caves might be, or if they would have collapsed.Prof Bruzzone and Prof Carrer’s work has now answered that question, although there is much more to be done to understand the full scale of the cave.“We have very good images of the surface - up to 25cm of resolution - we can see the Apollo landing sites - but we know nothing about what lies below the surface. There are huge opportunities for discovery,” Francesco Sauro, Coordinator of the Topical Team Planetary Caves of the European Space Agency, told BBC News.The research may also help us explore caves on Mars in the future, he says. That could open the door to finding evidence of life on Mars, because if it did exist, it would almost certainly have been inside caves protected from the elements on the planet’s surface.The Moon cave might be useful to humans, but the scientists also stress that it could help answer fundamental questions about the history of the Moon, and even our solar system.The rocks inside the cave will not be as damaged or eroded by space weather, so they can provide an extensive geological record going back billions of years.The research is published in the scientific journal Nature Astronomy.Graphic by Gerry Fletcher']"

Five men died while trying to visit the lost ship in a novel submersible.A joint memorial service will be held at sea in the coming days for them and the 1,500 passengers and crew who went down with Titanic in 1912.The new expedition is being mounted by the US company that has sole salvage rights and which to date has brought up some 5,500 objects from the wreck.But this latest visit is purely a reconnaissance mission, says RMS Titanic Inc, based in Atlanta, Georgia.Two robotic vehicles will dive to the ocean bottom to capture millions of high-resolution photographs and to make a 3D model of all the debris.""We want to see the wreck with a clarity and precision that\'s never before been achieved,"" explained co-expedition lead David Gallo.', 'The logistics ship Dino Chouest is going to be the base for operations out in the North Atlantic.Weather permitting, it should spend 20 days above the wreck, which lies in 3,800m (12,500ft) of water.It will be a poignant few weeks for all involved.One of the five who died on the OceanGate sub was Frenchman Paul-Henri (""PH"") Nargeolet. He was the director of research at RMS Titanic Inc and was due to lead this expedition.A plaque will be laid on the seabed in his honour.""It\'s tough but the thing about exploration is that there\'s an urge and a drive to keep going.

One will be fitted with an array of ultra-high-definition optical cameras and a special lighting system; the other will carry a sensor package that includes a lidar (laser) scanner.Together, they\'ll track back and forth across a 1.3km-by-0.97km section of seafloor.Evan Kovacs, who\'s in charge of the imaging programme, says his camera systems should produce millimetre resolution.""If all of the weather gods, the computer gods, the ROV gods, the camera gods -  if all those gods align, we should be able to capture Titanic and the wreck site in as close to digital perfection as you can get.

Rural domestic abuse convictions still 'woeful',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd19001kxelo#0,The BBC finds reports of domestic abuse in the countryside have gone up but convictions remain low.,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 01:42:36 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.106508,"['Victims of domestic abuse in the countryside are still being let down by a “woeful” number of convictions five years after a report criticised the work of several rural police forces, says its author.Former North Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Julia Mulligan said the latest figures for rural areas obtained by the BBC suggested there had been no “significant improvement in outcomes for victims and survivors”.The response of seven rural forces was found to be “largely inadequate” in 2019.Both police and prosecutors said they were now working hard to improve the investigation, prosecution and handling of domestic abuse in rural communities.', 'In 2019, the landmark “Captive and Controlled” report studied police responses to domestic abuse in Derbyshire, Devon and Cornwall, Dorset, Durham, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.It found the forces\' handling of domestic abuse in the countryside - where victims are often more isolated and abuse can go on 25% longer than in urban areas as a result - was ""largely inadequate"".Five years on and Freedom of Information figures obtained by the BBC show the number of offences reported to the seven forces has gone up by 15% compared with the year of the report.But, while there were more than 107,900 reports of domestic abuse between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, the number of successful convictions is significantly lower than the number of offences reported.Figures for the seven forces could only be provided for the nine months up to December 2023 but they show there were just 3,312 successful convictions.', 'Such low conviction numbers compared to the number of reports of domestic abuse reflect the picture across the whole of England and Wales but Julia Mulligan says it is of particular concern in rural areas.Mrs Mulligan said the BBC’s figures “do not suggest any significant improvement in outcomes for victims and survivors” in rural areas since her findings in July 2019.She told the BBC: “Conviction rates are woeful. This is of concern for all victims, but those suffering in rural communities are on average subject to abuse for longer.""The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) say they can only prosecute domestic abuse cases that are referred to them by the police. In the nine months up to December 2023, 5,546 domestic abuse suspects had been referred from the seven forces to the CPS; 60% of those cases resulted in successful convictions.“When a case is referred by officers to us for a charging decision, the data shows most will result in a prosecution and conviction,"" the spokesman said.', '“We know the overall number of prosecutions is still too low and have been working constructively with police to improve the investigation, prosecution and handling of domestic abuse.""Some of those police forces told the BBC that there were now more options available to stop domestic abuse, including civil court orders, Clare\'s Law disclosures to tell potential victims about their partner\'s violent past and local support services.But one abuse survivor told the BBC she feared a lack of police resources and training – together with the stresses facing farmers today - would see more victims left trapped in often isolated rural communities.Mother-of-three Kerry McClay, 49, who lives in a village in the Derbyshire Dales, survived months of mental, emotional and physical abuse by her husband, Kevin Wigley.That culminated with him trying to kill her by hitting her in the head with an axe before taking his own life in 2013.The couple had run a farm together but problems including bad weather and bovine TB outbreaks pushed her husband to breaking point.', ""She fears the issues facing farmers today – from months of bad weather and flooding to high fuel, feed and fertilizer costs – could see others struggle with their mental health and take it out on their partners and families.“My husband didn’t hit me or verbally abuse me for the majority of our marriage,” she told the BBC. “But because of the stresses that come with farming and the solitude that comes with it, he just had a breakdown and that was the result of it.“I do worry that there is a lot of stress on farmers today and in the farming environment that weighs down on a farmer.

Row over rise in water bills as firms say it's not enough,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyx0jxrq7y4o#0,Water firms have hit out at bill rises of £94 over the next five years after wanting bigger hikes.,"Thu, 11 Jul 2024 14:24:19 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.106708,"['A proposed average 21% hike in bills in England and Wales won\'t be enough to address problems including sewage leaks, water firms have warned.The firms are in a standoff with regulator Ofwat over proposed bill rises.Ofwat has said it wants firms to limit rises for households to an average of £19 per year until 2030.But water companies have hit back, saying the regulator had ""got this wrong"" and warned the bill rises wouldn\'t be enough to ""deal with the water shortages we know are coming"".Although the proposed average rise will put more pressure on households, it is a third less than the amount requested by water companies.The bill hike is intended to fund investment for improvements such as replacing leaking pipes and reducing sewage discharges into rivers and seas.It comes as suppliers face increasing scrutiny over and public anger over their environmental and financial performance, as well as executive bonuses and pay.The bill hike varies by region, with Thames Water customers facing an increase of £99 or 23% over the next five years, Anglian customers looking at £66 or 13%, and Southern Water customers facing £183, an increase of 44%.But this is less than firms had been requesting. For example, Thames Water\'s proposed increase of £191 by 2030 was reduced to £99, while Severn Trent\'s proposed increase of £144 was lowered to £93.The proposed bill rises can be challenged by the water firms, with a final determination due at the end of the year, and increases set to take place from April.David Henderson, chief executive of industry group Water UK, told BBC business editor Simon Jack that the regulators decision was ""unrealistic and unfair"".""Our economy and environment will pay the price,"" he added.A spokesperson for Water UK said the plans were ""the biggest ever cut in investment"" and argued ""the recovery of our rivers will be slower and we will fail to deal with the water shortages we know are coming"".But Ofwat chief executive David Black said its plan marked the ""biggest ever"" investment in the water sector and would mean ""sustained improvement to customer service and the environment at a fair price for customers"".He told Radio 4\'s Today Programme Ofwat was ""very concerned"" about the level of bonuses that the companies are paying. ""That’s why we have introduced new measures to protect customers. In the last year, no customer paid for executive bonuses.""', 'Labour has pledged a crackdown on the water industry, promising consumers higher compensation for sewage failures and the power to hold executives to account. It plans to introduce new measures to ensure that money earmarked for investment and improvements cannot be diverted to pay salaries or dividends.Speaking to LBC radio during his trip to the Nato summit in Washington DC, the prime minister Kier Starmer said the situation around the water industry had got ""completely out of hand"".He said Labour\'s plan would involve ""making sure the regulations we have are properly enforced, looking at possible further regulation, and something I\'m very keen on, which is to have sort of personal responsibility from the top"".Earlier the new Secretary of State for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, Steve Reed, spoke to water company bosses and said they had agreed to ""initial measures to clean up our waterways"".He rejected calls to nationalise water companies, saying it would ""cost money we do not have"" and take longer to slow down the process of lowering pollution levels in waterways.The Consumer Council for Water, an arms-length government body funded by a levy on people\'s water bills, estimated about two million households in England and Wales ""currently cannot afford their water bill"".It said an increase in assistance for struggling households was welcome but ""falls short of what is needed"", adding ""trust in water companies has never been lower"".', 'As well as the bill rises, the UK\'s biggest water firm, Thames Water, is being put under fresh scrutiny by Ofwat, with a new ""oversight regime"" to make sure the company improves its performance.The struggling debt-laden firm said this week that it had enough cash to fund its operations until the end of May next year as it continues to raise new investment.Ofwat said Thames Water must provide a ""delivery action plan"" and regularly report on progress, assessed by a third party.Thames Water is at risk of having the credit rating of its debts downgraded by S&P Global, the ratings agency said on Thursday.According to Ofwat, since privatisation 30 years ago, firms have paid out £53bn in dividends, but have also invested more than £200bn in infrastructure.However, in 2023, sewage spills into England\'s rivers and seas more than doubled.There were 3.6 million hours of spills last year, compared to 1.75 million hours in 2022, according to the Environment Agency.', 'Dave Wallace is a citizen scientist who has been testing the water in the River Thames where he lives in Henley after some children got ill last year.“I’d been swimming and found myself swimming in what I’d describe as solids and started wondering what on earth is going on.“We’ve actually found high levels of pollution and found very high levels of E. coli on the river.""He said he\'s now stopped swimming in the river after reports of an increase in sickness and diarrhoea, as well as people getting infected sores and contracting sepsis.“It’s not just people but dogs as well.

Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it’s possible,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0www3qvx2zo#0,Lara Lewington searches for the tech secrets that researchers hope will unlock eternal youth.,"Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:16:59 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.106899,"[""It's long been known that our lifestyles can help to keep us healthier for longer. Now scientists are asking whether new technology can also help slow down the ageing process of our brains by keeping track of what happens to them as we get older.One sunny morning, 76-year-old Dutch-born Marijke and her husband Tom welcomed me in for breakfast at their home in Loma Linda, an hour east of Los Angeles. Oatmeal, chai seeds, berries, but no processed sugary cereal or coffee were served - a breakfast as pure as Loma Linda’s mission.Loma Linda has been identified as one of the world’s so-called Blue Zones, places where people have lengthier-than-average lifespans. In this case, it is the city’s Seventh-Day Adventist Church community who are living longer.Listen to Lara read this article on BBC SoundsThey generally don’t drink alcohol or caffeine, stick to a vegetarian or even vegan diet and consider it a duty of their religion to look after their bodies as best they can. This is their “health message”, as they call it, and it has put them on the map - the city has been the subject of decades of research into why its residents live better for longer.Dr Gary Fraser from the University of Loma Linda told me members of the Seventh-Day Adventist community there can expect not only a longer lifespan, but an increased “healthspan” - that is, time spent in good health - of four to five years extra for women and seven years extra for men.Marijke and Tom had moved to the city later in life, but both were now firmly embedded in the community. "", ""There’s no great secret to Loma Linda. Its citizens are simply living a really healthy life, keeping mentally stimulated and valuing the community a religion can often provide.There are regular lectures on healthy living, musical get-togethers and exercise classes.I chatted to Judy, who lives with 112 others at an assisted living facility where there was always the “ability to have heart-opening, brain-opening conversations”, she told me.“What I didn't realise was how important socialisation is to your brain... without it, it seems to shrink and go away,” Judy said. Science has long recognised the benefits of social interactions and avoiding loneliness. But now it's also possible to identify whose brains are ageing faster than they should, so they can be tracked and in future potentially be treated better preventatively. As we move towards more personalised, predictive, preventative healthcare models, early diagnosis will be crucial in all areas of health - powered by the incredible possibilities of AI and big data."", 'Click: Mind over matterLara Lewington travels to California to meet the scientists and experts researching our brain health and investigating whether we can change how our brains age.Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK only)', 'Computer models that assess how our brains age and predict their decline were shown to me by Andrei Irimia, associate professor of gerontology and computational biology at the University of Southern California.He had created them using MRI scans, data from 15,000 brains and the power of artificial intelligence to understand the trajectory of both brains that are ageing healthily and those in which there is a disease process, such as dementia. “It\'s a very sophisticated way to look at patterns that we don\'t necessarily know about as humans, but the AI algorithm is able to pick up on them,” he said.Prof Irimia did, of course, take a look inside my head. I\'d had a functional MRI scan ahead of my visit and, after analysing its results, Prof Irimia told me I had a brain age eight months older than my chronological age (although apparently the bit that controls talking wasn’t ageing so much. I could have told him that). However, Prof Irimia suggested that the results fall within a two-year error margin.Private companies are starting to commercialise this technology, too. One firm, Brainkey, is offering the service in a variety of clinics around the world. Its founder Owen Philips told me that in future, getting an MRI should become easier.""It’s becoming much more accessible for people to get an MRI scan, and the images coming off them are getting even better and better,” he said. “I don\'t mean to nerd out there. But the technology is just getting to a point where we are able to see things much earlier than we could in the past. And that means we can understand exactly what\'s happening in an individual patient\'s brain. With AI, we can support that.”In contrast to what Prof Irimia’s analysis of my MRI scan had told me, Brainkey’s estimate knocked a year off my brain’s biological age. I was also presented with a 3D-printed model of it, which appeared substantial and, I was assured, was life-sized.  ', 'The aim here is not just a more precise approach to treatment, but also to be able to quantify how well any interventions are working.Dramatic increases in life expectancy over the past 200 years have given rise to a host of age-related diseases. I did wonder whether, if we all lived long enough, dementia might come knocking at all our doors.Prof Irimia said this was a theory many have investigated albeit not proven, adding that the aim was to find a way to keep on pushing dementia back, hopefully beyond our life expectancies.And all of this takes us back to the same point. Every scientist and doctor, as well as those Blue Zoners, say lifestyle is key. Good diet, keeping active, mentally stimulated and happy are crucial to how our brains age.There’s another important factor too, according to Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the best-selling book Why We Sleep.“Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do every day to reset your brain and body health,” he evangelised. “There is no operation of your mind that is not wonderfully enhanced when you get sleep, or demonstrably impaired when you don’t get enough.”He spoke of our brains’ cleansing system, which functions during our slumber by washing away the beta-amyloid and tau proteins - these are “two of the main culprits underlying Alzheimer’s”.Changes in sleep patterns are also associated with dementia. Prof Walker described how we don’t just see this in our 60s or 70s - it can begin during our 30s. So, identifying those changes through sleep tracking could potentially become a “model of midlife prevention”.', ""Fauna Bio, a biotech company on the outskirts of San Francisco, is collecting data on ground squirrels during and after hibernation. In this state of torpor, as it is known, the squirrels’ body temperature drops and their metabolic rate is reduced to just 1% of normal. During this time, they appear to be able to regrow neurons and remake the connections their brains had lost. The company’s aim is to try and create drugs to replicate this process in humans, without them needing to spend half the year underground. Even if some may long for that.Untreated depression has also been shown to raise our risk of dementia. Professor Leanne Williams of Stanford University has identified a method of “visualising” some forms of depression on the brain using an MRI scan, and thus seeing if treatment has worked. This may be able to help scientists understand more about the root causes of mental health conditions such as depression, as well as providing a way to quantify how treatment is going for a patient.Few have put more faith in science to achieve longevity than Bryan Johnson - the tech entrepreneur spending millions in an effort to reverse his biological age. Dozens of supplements, 19 hours a day of fasting, workouts that make him look as though he’s going to burst and an array of (sometimes controversial) treatments are what he hopes will turn back the clock.The tech entrepreneur betting he can get youngerBut as 103-year-old Mildred, who I visited in Loma Linda said forcefully, “You absolutely need to be very careful with your diet, it’s true, but I’m not down for, ‘You've got to do this, and this, and this, and absolutely not touch this!\u202f'”.

IVF help for wild rhinos from zoo cousins,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cekkjnx9xz7o#1,Scientists are collecting eggs from rhinos in zoos in a bid to boost the gene pool of wild rhinos.,"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 23:47:19 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.107083,"['Collecting eggs from a two tonne rhino is far from easy - but the procedure is being carried out in zoos across Europe in a bid to help the wild population.The hope is that cutting-edge fertility technology could boost the genetic diversity of southern white rhinos in Africa.The species was almost extinct, plummeting to a few dozen rhinos  - so the animals are all descended from this tiny group.Scientists believe rhinos in zoos, which have more genetic diversity because they are carefully cross bred, could widen the gene pool with the help of IVF.It’s technology that has seen a recent breakthrough: in January, researchers announced that they had achieved the world’s first rhino IVF pregnancy.', ""One of the animals taking part in the southern white zoo project is 22-year-old Zanta from Dublin Zoo in Ireland. “Zanta has wonderful genetics that are worth preserving, but we know from a previous reproductive assessment that she can’t breed,” says Frank O’Sullivan, a vet at the zoo.“The main reason we want to do the procedure is to bypass that, harvest her eggs and then they'll be fertilised. The great thing is Zanta will be represented in future generations of rhinos.”"", 'A team of fertility specialists from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany has flown to Ireland to carry out the procedure.Zanta is anaesthetized with a dart, then once she’s fully sedated the scientists get to work.Amidst the regular beeps of the equipment monitoring Zanta’s vital signs, the researchers cluster around a screen that’s showing an ultrasound of the rhino’s ovaries.She’s been given special hormone injections to help her produce eggs. The researchers are able to locate them inside follicles, small sacs of fluid, that appear as black circles on the screen.Using an ultra-fine needle, and a great deal of precision, they are able to extract the eggs.', 'It’s taken the team a long time to develop this technology.The IVF pregnancy announced in January was in southern whites - with the team successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother.A calf was never born because the mother died from an unrelated bacterial infection early in the pregnancy. However, the scientists believe the pregnancy shows the technique is viable.Their ultimate aim is to repeat this with the southern white rhino’s all but extinct cousin - the northern white rhino - for a project called Biorescue. There are only two of these animals left on the planet - both of them females.But the scientists believe the reproductive advances they’ve made could also help with the southern white rhino’s genetic problems.', 'Today southern whites number in their thousands, but it wasn’t always that way.At the end of the 19th Century, the species was almost wiped out through hunting and land clearance. Some estimates suggest there were as few as 20 animals left.The animals have slowly bounced back and now they are classified as near threatened, but starting off from this very small group has left them with a lack of genetic diversity.', 'This puts them at risk, says Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, the director of reproduction at Leibniz IZW.“If you have a very narrow gene pool, a virus, for example, can jump from one individual to the other because each individual is the same and the immune system acts like the same,” he explained.Southern whites in zoos, on the other hand, have more diversity because of the way their breeding is carefully planned.“We’re trying to apply this new technology to rescue Zanta’s genes and bring them back to Africa, so that we have a wider gene pool for the future,” he says.', ""In a makeshift lab next to the rhino enclosure, the scientists peer intently into a microscope to assess what they’ve collected.Susanne Holtze, part of the Leibniz team, says that they’ve managed to harvest four eggs.  Rhino IVF is still in its infancy - a calf has not yet been born from the technique - but the team is building a store of embryos made with eggs and sperm collected from across Europe and the hope is that they can one day be implanted into surrogates.“It's a lot of effort and in the end we actually come home with a few cells. But these cells have the potential to become embryos and to form a new rhino - a huge two tonne animal, so it’s worth it,” Dr Holtze said."", ""Back in the enclosure, not long after the procedure has been completed, Zanta wakes up.She’s a little unsteady on her feet at first, but once everyone is sure she’s OK, she heads outside. Her keeper calls her name and she soon strolls over for a gentle scratch behind her ears.Although she doesn’t know it, the few eggs that she's donated could make a big difference, helping the survival of future generations of southern white rhinos.Photos by Kevin Church ""]"
Footage reveals 'miracle eagle chick' in flight,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c047gl9zyx3o#1,"A white-tailed eagle that broke its wing has taken to the skies after its parents nursed it back to health.

The youngster\'s wing was broken when the nest fell to the ground during unseasonably wild weather last year. The footage shows a bulge in the bird\'s wing - apparently a healed broken bone.Mull’s RSPB officer, Dave Sexton, who described the bird as a ""miracle chick"", said: “We normally think of eagles as ‘hard-wired’ and unemotional but clearly there might be another side to their nature."" ', 'It is a story that had a stormy start, when the chick badly injured its left wing last July after its nest was blown down. The young, injured eagle finally took to the skies in the autumn, but Dave Sexton described its flight as “wobbly”. The new footage, captured by wildlife photographer Gary Jones, shows a visible lump in its wing - probably a healed broken bone. ', 'RSPB officer Dave spotted the juvenile this spring - alive and well and in a new nest in an area owned by North West Mull Community Woodland. The fully-grown chick was being fed fish by its parents, caring behaviour that the eagle expert described as “unprecedented” for the birds. “In 30 years of watching them, I’ve never seen anything like it,"" he said. ""I’ve also consulted with other eagle experts at home and abroad, and so far no-one else has reported this kind of extended parenting behaviour for an injured chick.”', 'White-tailed eagles are the UK\'s largest birds of prey - with wingspans that can reach 2.4m. Their chicks normally hatch in April and are fed in the nest until they fledge in July. By October, most young will disperse and start to fend for themselves.“They wander far and wide until they’re five years old and start to look for a mate and a territory of their own,” Dave explained. “If an immature bird was to reappear near its nesting parents or any other pair the following year, it would likely be aggressively chased away. That’s why this is so exceptional.For now, Dave said, he and other local eagle-watchers are enjoying watching this “unusual” family doing what they want to do and caring for their youngster.""I’d still describe its flight as ‘wonky’ at best,"" he told BBC News. ""But you have to admire its will to survive against the odds – with a little helping hand from mum and dad. “I loved white-tailed eagles before,” he added. “Now I think I love them just a little bit more.”']"
"No, UK weather is not being manipulated",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckmmkdr0m2po#1,False claims about weather manipulation and geoengineering have been spreading online. What are the facts?,"Thu, 04 Jul 2024 02:02:46 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.107501,"['June\'s weather may have felt erratic at times - but for some social media users, there was nothing random about it. They wrongly blamed it on ""weather manipulation"" and ""geoengineering"". Others accused weather presenters of ""hiding the truth"" from the public.  Much of June experienced temperatures about 2C (3.6F) lower than average, due to colder air coming from the Arctic.That was reversed in the last week of the month as warmer air moved in, bringing the UK temperature closer to normal, but still 0.4C colder than average.Combined with one of the wettest winters in recent years, this has left many wondering what is going on with the British weather.But not all possible explanations circulating on social media are grounded in scientific evidence.', 'To some users, the recent cooler weather suggests climate change may not be real. But short-term weather events are not representative of long-term climate trends in the UK.And recent decades have also proved warmer, wetter, and sunnier than those in the 20th Century, as the climate continues to change.But among those who deny the existence of climate change, an alternative theory has been gaining momentum. It alleges that the government is supposedly controlling both weather and climate for sinister purposes.Variations of this narrative have been circulating online for years, but in the aftermath of unusual weather events it tends to resurface on all major social media platforms.By using social media analytics tools, BBC Verify found that conversation around these topics has been gaining momentum this year. Since January, mentions of #GeoEngineering on X more than doubled worldwide, compared with the last six months of 2023. BBC Verify found thousands of tweets spreading falsehoods and conspiracy theories. These claims often lump together processes that are largely different from each other, such as weather modification and geoengineering.', ""The most well-known form of weather modification is cloud seeding - a technique through which tiny particles are released into existing clouds to produce rain or snow.Cloud seeding has been around for decades, and has been deployed in places like the US, China and the United Arab Emirates, mostly to help tackle water shortages.On social media, some users have claimed that high levels of rainfall across the UK could only be explained by the deployment of cloud seeding on an industrial scale.This is false.On a rapidly warming planet, warm air is able to hold more moisture, which in turn fuels more intense rainfall.Climate change may not be the only factor behind the UK’s waterlogged winter, but it has certainly played an important role in it.While the UK government funded cloud seeding experiments in the 1950s, the Met Office says it is not aware of any activity connected to weather modification taking place in the UK in recent years.In addition to that, cloud seeding can only have small, targeted impacts. It does not affect long-term weather or the climate.That is where the idea of geoengineering comes in.Geoengineering is an umbrella term most commonly used to describe attempts to manipulate the environment, with the goal of reducing the effects of climate change.Under current climate policies, the Earth is likely to heat up by more than 1.5C in the next few decades, breaching a key climate threshold.As the clock ticks away, some scientists believe governments should be looking into alternative methods of cooling the Earth.This could involve capturing and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - something the UK is actively researching.But there is no evidence to suggest that removing gases like carbon dioxide has any impact on short-term weather.   Cooling the Earth could also be achieved through solar radiation management - a process through which some of the Sun's energy that reaches Earth is reflected back into space."", 'The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says the UK government is “not deploying solar radiation management” and that it has “no plans to do so”.And yet, some social media users claim, without evidence, that a cover-up is taking place - one in which BBC Weather and other forecasters are playing a key role (or so those users allege).“Imagine watching the geoengineers at work, and you report the weather without telling the truth about what really is going on,” wrote one user on X. “That is sick!”', 'Many of these users were also found to frequently tweet about “chemtrails”, a widely debunked conspiracy theory about a secretive plot to spray people with dangerous chemicals.The Royal Meteorological Society condemns the abuse weather forecasters have been receiving - which, it says, can have chilling effects.“We work very closely with young scientists to encourage them to share their science with the public,” says Prof Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society. “But they are fearful of the trolling that might take place.”Others argue that it may also affect research into geoengineering, as potential donors may be reluctant to put their money into projects the public may perceive as “controversial”.“A lot of funders are very sceptical of funding research,” says Dr Ramit Debnath, an assistant professor at the University of Cambridge, who investigated how online conversations about geoengineering have been hijacked by conspiracy theories.“It’s this whole idea that someone is trying to control our natural resources, our environment - and that, through that intervention, we are trying to control or take away people’s freedom,” he says.']"

Three legs, no tail. Piteous look on its face. No genitalia. It\'s there in my arms. And it was a life changing moment,” he later told Sheen.""I wanted to know who was responsible for this, what had caused it.  And I wanted those people to be held accountable.""', 'Douglas knew where to start.The farm was next to a landfill site, called Brofiscin Quarry.He collected samples from the water escaping the landfill and sent them to a laboratory, where scientists found a famous fire-retardant type of chemical called poly-chlorinated biphenyls - more commonly known as PCBs.PCBs are now known to be highly toxic and production of the chemicals is banned in 151 countries, including the UK.But back in the 1960s, the chemicals were celebrated and used in products like paint and paper to stop them from catching fire.The chemicals were largely associated with one company - a US chemical giant called Monsanto - whose European factory was in Newport, south Wales. The company is no longer in existence.The company had produced thousands of tonnes of surplus PCBs which were being buried in dumpsites.Douglas began to fear that the chemical was getting into the food chain - via fields, cattle, meat and milk.He also feared that PCBs were so-called forever chemicals, meaning they would never biodegrade.', ""Can we take the 'forever' out of forever chemicals?Where do 'forever chemicals' in drinking water come from?Listen: Inside Science - Forever chemicals"", ""Douglas was sure he was on to something and worked for years to prove it.But at the time there was disagreement, as the government's own tests from the site revealed lower levels of PCBs.Douglas, who died in 2018 at the age of 74, believed there was a conspiracy to silence him and spent a period of time in witness protection.Most of his key documents were never put into the public domain.After he died, his confidential documents ended up with an MP who agreed to share them with the hosts of a new podcast called Buried: The Last Witness on BBC Radio 4.Perhaps the biggest twist of the series is how Michael Sheen came to be involved."", '""I\'m just sitting in my house in LA, kind of going mad over the computer, thinking \'I\'ve stumbled across something\',"" Sheen told Dan and Lucy.""Well, not thinking I\'ve stumbled across something. Thinking, I\'m finding out about something that surely people must know about, because this is extraordinary.""Sheen tracked Douglas down in 2017 just a year before he died.The actor then spent a weekend with Douglas, during which he recorded his full story.""He seemed very into wanting to tell his story, and also I think it became clear he felt like he might not have long to tell it. ""I suppose, if anything, I was expecting a kind of anti-establishment, rebel, maverick, \'stick it to the man\' kind of bloke, and that is not at all what I found,"" said Sheen.Douglas, who returned to the south Wales farm to take multiple samples over the years, believed being exposed to PCBs had taken a toll on his health.""I\'ve got all sorts of problems. Of which… I think virtually all can be attributed to my exposure to PCBs,"" Douglas told Sheen in the recording.Douglas was angry, because he said PCBs had cost him and feared they would cost many others in the future.But he was angrier still that nobody did anything.The podcast\'s producer Dan Ashby said: ""Most true-crime series have a victim, who we all feel empathy for. ""But in this one, we know the poison, we know the culprits, but the scary question is this: are we all the victims?

Crossbows and eerie silences – following Antarctic whales for climate change clues,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj770nrx0x9o#1,How scientists are discovering secrets of Antarctic climate change in the bodies of giant humpback whales. ,"Sat, 08 Jun 2024 00:06:47 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.108103,"['Inside the bodies of humpback whales are clues about how climate change is transforming Antarctica. Our BBC science team crossed the Southern Ocean, with the researchers, on a mission to follow and study the giant whales of this remote, frozen wilderness. ', 'At 03:00 in the morning there is an almighty crash. Every drawer in our cabin is flung open and contents hurled against the wall. We hit a 12-metre wave.I’m not a seafarer; this is alarming, but apparently not unusual on the Drake Passage - the stretch of the notoriously rough Southern Ocean we are on. We’re aboard a 200-passenger tourist ship, with a team of wildlife scientists, on our way to the Antarctic Peninsula.', 'One of the researchers, Dr Natalia Botero-Acosta has an arresting piece of equipment in her hand luggage - a custom-made crossbow. “It’s not a weapon,” she explains. “It’s a scientific tool we use to collect whale skin and blubber samples.”Using the crossbow and a drone, the researchers will carry out up-close health checks on every humpback whale they can find, to work out if these massive mammals are getting enough to eat.', 'It is an important question - not just for mighty, 40-tonne humpbacks that travel thousands of kilometres to gorge themselves in the cold seas - but for the health of the ocean and our planet.', 'In the rich, freezing seas off the peninsula, penguins, seals and many whales feed on Antarctic krill. These diminutive, almost unimaginably numerous, shrimp-like creatures thrive under sea ice. As the climate warms up, scientists are racing to understand what that means for this ice-dependent food supply.', 'Early on our first Antarctic morning, in mercifully calm coastal waters, we set out on a small, inflatable boat called a zodiac.Cloud is descending and it is starting to snow. Leading our Antarctic whale research mission is Chris Johnson, who is the wildlife charity WWF’s global expert on whale conservation.In conditions like this,” says Chris, “the best way to find whales is to listen - we’ll switch off the zodiac engine and close our eyes.”The silence is transformational. Multiple, overlapping blows of whale exhalations echo off mountains that rise vertically out of glassy water. Gigantic, hungry humpbacks are feeding in this bay. All around our small boat, animals are breathing, then diving - opening their cavernous mouths to let krill-laden seawater rush in.We head slowly in the direction of the nearest blows and Natalia reaches for her crossbow.The giant mammals build up chemical clues about their environment in their blubber - clues that Natalia plans to collect.', 'She picks up one of the crossbow bolts. On the business end, there is a 3cm metal tip that plucks a piece of skin and blubber from the whale’s body. A rubber stopper prevents the bolt from penetrating further: It grabs a sample, then bounces off the animal and floats in the water.“It’s 3cm from an animal that’s 14m long - so it’s like a mosquito bite,” says Natalia. Sure enough, when her bolt takes a nick out of the body of a huge, female whale, the animal doesn’t flinch.It’s a mother, side-by-side with her calf. She seems intrigued - circling our boat slowly, then gliding directly underneath. Her giant head and white pectoral fins - fringed with barnacles - are visible as she slowly floats beneath us.“Hold on in case she comes up,” says Chris. But mother whale glides on, surfacing on the other side of us with a blow.', 'The calf is even more curious, raising its head out of the water. The young marine mammal seems to examine us; we’re a strange group of tiny, terrestrial mammals in a small, rubber boat. I can’t stop myself greeting the calf: “Hello, beautiful.”Baby humpbacks spend a year\xa0nursing on their mothers’ rich milk. With a hungry, one-tonne newborn, calories are important.“We need to find the most critical feeding habitats for whales, so we can protect them,” explains Chris.The health of whales, he explains, shines a light on the health of the whole Antarctic ecosystem. And whales are physically necessary for a healthy ocean: Humpbacks eat krill, and krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice - plants that absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. Whales then poop (in vast quantities) and fertilise the marine plants.It’s a virtuous, productive cycle that climate change is disrupting. “These are natural processes we rely on for fresh air, food and clean water,” says Chris. “Places like this are important for all of us.”', 'There is a group of humpbacks in this bay and Natalia sets up to take another biopsy. She seems in sync with the whale. When it arches its back above the surface, that’s the moment - and the ideal, blubber-rich area - for her to aim for. There’s a gentle “thunk” as the bolt bounces off the whale, taking its nugget of tissue.Back in her lab at the University of California Santa Cruz, Natalia will be able to tell if this whale was hungry, stressed or pregnant from chemical signals, or hormones, that build up in its blubber.“Pregnancy data is so valuable,’ Natalia says. “My colleague previously found that, in years when there is low sea ice, you have lower pregnancy rates. [We’re really seeing] the effect of climate change - and all these conservation threats - on the animals.”Most mature humpbacks here will eat about three million Antarctic krill each day, as they bulk up for a 8,000km journey back to breeding grounds in the tropical Pacific.', 'While a single krill is just 6cm long fully-gown, collectively they weigh about 400 million tonnes. That is similar to the combined weight of every human on Earth. The swarms of krill here depend on sea ice - they graze on its algae and survive in its crevices. Marine ecologist Prof Angus Atkinson from Plymouth Marine Laboratory says climate change is a threat to krill. “Since 2017, there has been a worrying decline in Antarctic sea ice,” he says. In 2023, it reached a record low, with over 2 million sq km less ice than usual during winter.Another way the team is studying the whales here is from above - with a drone. The remotely controlled aerial cameras mean scientists can record spectacular displays of behaviour that can’t be seen from the surface.Chris launches his drone and we watch a group of humpbacks perform a perfect demonstration of bubble net feeding. Working together, they blow bubbles in a spiral, trapping the krill swarm. Like colossal, synchronised swimmers, they lunge through the middle of the bubble net open-mouthed.', 'One whale creates a solo bubble net, then sweeps krill into its mouth with a huge fin. “It’s using its pectoral fin as a tool,” says Chris.The drone doesn’t just provide a spectacular view - it’s used to weigh the whales. Chris explains: “We measure the length and width of their bodies to work out how fat they’re getting during the season.”Scientists have seen evidence of whales “getting skinny” because of a climate-linked food shortages. One study of Southern right whales - that feed on krill, then migrate to the South African coast to give birth - showed that the animals are 20% thinner compared to 30 years ago.Krill are difficult to count and it isn’t clear if numbers are declining, but research has shown that the population is moving south into colder water. A regular check on humpbacks’ weight will provide more clues. Krill biologist Prof So Kawaguchi from the Australian Antarctic Division says it’s vital to understand the whole life cycle and the behaviour of krill. “If climate change affects the behaviour and distribution of the swarms, some predators are going to suffer,” he says. “Krill could move out of their reach.”', 'Whales shrinking is an indicator of poor health, explains Chris. “There are multiple causes - climate change, fisheries, ship strikes and underwater noise pollution - it’s all adding up.”There is a krill fishery in the Southern Ocean. The oil is used in to make some animal feeds and supplements. Strict catch limits are designed to protect Antarctic wildlife, but the WWF wants some areas designated no fishing zones to protect whales’ food supply. “We’re advocating closing off really sensitive wildlife feeding habitats,” Chris explains.As Chris looks intently at his drone display, he suddenly calls out: “Mom’s pooping!”The aerial view shows a female humpback relaxing near our boat, right next to a large volume of floating faeces. Biologist Sarah Kienle grabs a large sample jar from the kit bag and leans over the side to scoop some up.The waste has the aroma of highly concentrated rotting fish, but Sarah is delighted. “Whale poop is so hard to find and it contains all this information about what they’re eating. We can even get DNA and hormones from it. It’s liquid, smelly gold!”', 'Back aboard the ship, the team use a store room as a makeshift laboratory. At a small table, Natalia and Sarah take each sample from its arrow-tip casing and put it in a sealed tube to be transported back to Natalia’s lab.On the ship, the samples go into a freezer. On the long journey home though, Natalia travels with her samples tucked into a small, insulated picnic box. She often asks cabin crew on a flight for ice from the drinks cart to ensure her precious samples are kept as cold as possible.While working from a tourist ship has its limitations, it means the team can work in several sites around the peninsula. “Scientists and the tourists want to get to the same places - hotspots of biodiversity and animals,” explains Sarah, who has joined the team from Baylor University in Texas.The tour company, Intrepid, provides space and facilities for the scientists. For the team, Chris says, being on the ship means access to one of the most remote places on Earth.', ""Tourism can leave its mark. The number of people who make the trip to Antarctica for a holiday has increased dramatically in recent years. In the season between 2022 and 2023, a record 104,000 people visited. Before the 1980s, just a few hundred people came each year.Antarctic adventures have a high carbon footprint, and any visitor - scientist, tourist or journalist - could unwittingly bring in seeds or microbes that do not belong on clothes or boots. Expedition guides on this trip actually vacuum out passengers' backpacks and pockets to help prevent that. Bobbles on hats are discouraged when ashore - they can shed fibres.But there is evidence that experiencing the frozen continent in person can inspire visitors to advocate for its protection.Working in this way also means researchers operate on the tourist ship’s schedule, with just four full days travelling around the Peninsula before heading back across the infamous Drake Passage."", 'On the last day, two whales the team are following suddenly stop next to an iceberg and stop moving. “They’ve fallen asleep,” explains Natalia.Natalia approaches every animal with care. And she has the best chance to get a good sample from a moving whale - as it arches out of the water. “I’m going to put a bolt in the water, just to make a splash and see if it will wake them up,” she explains.Thunk.Splash.Nothing. “They didn’t move,” she smiles. “No reaction whatsoever. They’re very sleepy.”', 'Finally, the two whales stir and Natalia takes her final shot to get one last, precious sample containing information about what is happening to this environment and the wildlife that depends on it.This is a place that humanity depends on too - a productive, icy ocean that helps cool our planet. Working out exactly how it is changing means monitoring it.So the scientists hope to return to this frozen wilderness next summer to keep up their regular health check in on its largest inhabitants.']"

It also intends to set up a tree-planting taskforce to grow millions more trees across the UK.It will also introduce a new Community Right to Buy to help groups transform derelict land into new green spaces.', 'Temporary approval for banned neonicotinoids that harm bees will also be stopped, it says.Labour’s shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, said: ""The next Labour government will protect and restore nature, safeguarding our beautiful countryside for future generations to experience and enjoy.”The Liberal Democrats said they had “credible policies” to double the amount of land that is protected and managed for nature by 2050.Tim Farron, the party\'s spokesperson for the environment, said: “We need to double the amount of land that is protected and managed for nature, doubling the most important habitats, and importantly doubling the species in these areas.""No detailed budgeting has yet been produced for the parties\' plans to protect UK wildlife.Plaid Cymru said an increase in public investment would be “essential for managing land, restoring habitats, and supporting nature policies”. The SNP has previously said it is committed to halting biodiversity loss by 2030.The BBC has approached the SNP for comment on their current election policies on nature.']"
Call for UK agency to regulate harmful chemicals,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdd4dzr40ro#1,The Royal Society of Chemistry says the current regulation of chemicals is 'not fit for purpose'.,"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 09:12:02 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.109402,"['The UK is at risk of ""uncontrolled chemicals"" which could harm people and the environment, say experts.The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) has called for the establishment of a Chemicals Agency to take charge of the regulation of chemicals in the UK.It said the rise in the use of pollutants often referred to as ‘forever chemicals’ is an example of where regulation is “falling through the cracks”.The government has been approached for comment.', ""RSC said they decided to make a public intervention after waiting for more than four years for clarity on how chemicals should be regulated following the UK’s exit from the EU.Prior to 2020, the UK and the 27 current EU countries worked in tandem to research and monitor chemicals, and set rules around their use. Following Brexit, the UK has undertaken sole responsibility for chemical regulation domestically, but there have been delays establishing a new system.“The current regulatory regime for chemicals in the UK is not fit-for-purpose, failing to support innovation or to adequately protect our waterways, soil, air and built environment,” said Professor Gillian Reid, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry.Last month the government announced it was consulting on a new chemicals’ registration process – intended to be the key mechanism by which the UK will track which chemicals are being imported into the country.The process was intended to be in place from the day the UK officially left the EU, four years ago, in 2020. The RSC said the delay is impacting dozens of industries which operate across the UK and EU market - from cosmetics, to food manufacturing, to agriculture.Stephanie Metzger, policy advisor at the RSC and co-author of the report, said: “Businesses are in this 'limbo' phase. This makes it really difficult for them to plan financially what they are going to invest in, and decide what research they might want to do.”"", 'The Chemical Industries Association (CIA), the trade body for businesses working with chemicals, agreed that its members needed clarity, but said it was “premature” to call for a Chemicals Agency, claiming it would merely delay the government process further.The Royal Society of Chemistry maintains that a centralised Chemicals Agency will also help to coordinate scientific studies.  At the moment, the RSC claims research into different chemicals can take place across more than five government agencies, leading to “fragmentation, duplication of efforts and a lack of clarity”, according to Prof Reid.“In addition, the civil service is under-resourced and struggling to recruit and train skilled staff, making it difficult for government to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in chemicals and testing,” she said.', 'In the last few years there has been growing evidence of the presence of potentially toxic chemicals like PFAS - or Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances - building up in UK soil and waterways.High doses of these pollutants, also known as ‘forever chemicals’, have been linked to serious health concerns, including cancer and fertility issues.Last week, researchers at the University of Cardiff found traces of a forever chemical which had never been manufactured in the UK present in an otter population in northeast England.Dr Elizabeth Chadwick, from Cardiff University, who co-authored the research paper, said a ban on forever chemicals is challenging because they are widely used and there are more than 15,000 types in circulation.“I think we need to do some work to really understand how the different groups of PFAS may have slightly different toxic effects, to help inform the regulation,"" she said. ""Which ones do we really need to focus on first?""The EU is currently researching a possible ban on forever chemicals by 2026. Last year, the UK government also announced it would develop a strategy for PFAS, but no paper has been published as yet.']"
Satellite to probe mystery of clouds and climate ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyddezqrlmvo#1,Europe's Earthcare satellite will tell us if the planet could lose the cooling effect of clouds.,"Tue, 28 May 2024 22:31:45 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.109607,"[""A sophisticated joint European-Japanese satellite has launched to measure how clouds influence the climate.Some low-level clouds are known to cool the planet, others at high altitude will act as a blanket.The Earthcare mission will use a laser and a radar to probe the atmosphere to see precisely where the balance lies.It's one of the great uncertainties in the computer models used to forecast how the climate will respond to increasing levels of greenhouse gases."", '""Many of our models suggest cloud cover will go down in the future and that means that clouds will reflect less sunlight back to space, more will be absorbed at the surface and that will act as an amplifier to the warming we would get from carbon dioxide,"" Dr Robin Hogan, from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, told BBC News.The 2.3-tonne satellite was sent up from California on a SpaceX rocket.The project is led by the European Space Agency (Esa), which has described it as the organisation\'s most complex Earth observation venture to date.Certainly, the technical challenge in getting the instruments to work as intended has been immense. It\'s taken fully 20 years to go from mission approval to launch.', ""Earthcare will circle the Earth at a height of about 400km (250 miles).It's actually got four instruments in total that will work in unison to get at the information sought by climate scientists.The simplest is an imager - a camera that will take pictures of the scene passing below the spacecraft to give context to the measurements made by the other three instruments.Earthcare's European ultraviolet laser will see the thin, high clouds and the tops of clouds lower down. It will also detect the small particles and droplets (aerosols) in the atmosphere that influence the formation and behaviour of clouds.The Japanese radar will look into the clouds, to determine how much water they are carrying and how that's precipitating as rain, hail and snow.And a radiometer will sense how much of the energy falling on to Earth from the Sun is being reflected or radiated back into space."", '""The balance between this outgoing total amount of radiation and the amount coming in from the Sun is what fundamentally drives our climate,"" said Dr Helen Brindley from the UK\'s National Centre for Earth Observation.""If we change that balance, for example by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, we reduce the amount of outgoing energy compared to what\'s coming in and we heat the climate.""As well as the long-term climate perspective, Earthcare\'s data will be used in the here and now to improve weather forecasts. For example, how a storm develops will be influenced by the initial state of its clouds as they were observed by the satellite days earlier.', 'The original science concept for Earthcare was put forward by Prof Anthony Illingworth, from Reading University, and colleagues in 1993.He said it was a dream come true to see the satellite finally fly: ""It\'s been a long and challenging journey with an amazing team of dedicated scientists and engineers from the UK and abroad. Together, we\'ve created something truly remarkable that will change the way we understand our planet.""One of the key technical struggles was the space laser, or lidar.Developer Airbus-France had a torrid time arriving at a design that would reliably work in the vacuum of space. A fundamental re-configuration of the instrument was needed, which not only resulted in delay but added significantly to the eventual cost of the mission, which today is valued at some €850m (£725m).', '""These aren\'t missions that you put up to be cheap and quick, to solve small problems; this is complex. The reason Earthcare has taken so long is because we want the gold standard,"" said Dr Beth Greenaway, the head of Earth observation at the UK Space Agency.Earthcare won\'t have long to gather its data. Flying at 400km means it will feel the drag of the residual atmosphere at that altitude. This will work to pull the satellite down.""It\'s got fuel for three years with the reserve of another year. It\'s basically lifetime-limited by its low orbit and the drag there,"" said Esa\'s Dr Michael Eisinger.The industrial development of Earthcare was led by Airbus-Germany, with the basic chassis, or structure, of the spacecraft built in the UK. Britain also supplied the radiometer, from Thales Alenia Space UK, and the imager, from Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. GMV-UK has prepared the ground systems that will process all the data.', 'The Japanese space agency (Jaxa), because of its strong interest in the mission, will follow its usual practice of giving the spacecraft a nickname - ""Hakuryu"" or ""White Dragon"".In Japanese mythology, dragons are ancient and divine creatures that govern water and fly in the sky. This year, 2024, also happens to be the Japanese Year of the Dragon, known as ""tatsu-doshi"".There\'s a connection in the appearance of the satellite, too, which is covered in white insulation and has a long, trailing solar panel, resembling a tail.""Earthcare, like a dragon rising into space, will become an entity that envisions the future for us,"" said Jaxa project manager Eiichi Tomita.']"

Europe's Ariane-6 rocket blasts off on maiden flight,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19km33k1mpo#2,"After a successful launch, the upper-stage of the rocket goes on to experience an anomaly.","Tue, 09 Jul 2024 23:56:16 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.110207,"['Europe\'s big new rocket, Ariane-6, has blasted off on its maiden flight.The vehicle set off from a launchpad in French Guiana at 16:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on a demonstration mission to put a clutch of satellites in orbit.Crews on the ground in Kourou applauded as the rocket - developed at a cost of €4bn (£3.4bn) - soared into the sky.But after climbing smoothly to the desired altitude, and correctly releasing a number of small satellites, the upper-stage of the rocket experienced an anomaly right at the end of the flight.Computers onboard took the decision to prematurely shut down the auxiliary power unit (APU) that pressurises the propulsion system.This left Ariane\'s upper-stage unable to initiate the burn that was supposed to bring it out of orbit and also set up the final task of the mission – to jettison two re-entry capsules.Controllers were unable to remedy the situation, but the flight was nonetheless still declared a success.""We\'re relieved; we\'re excited,"" said Josef Aschbacher, the director general of the European Space Agency.""This is a historic moment. The inaugural launch of a new heavy-lift rocket doesn\'t happen every year; it happens only every 20 years or maybe 30 years. And today we have launched Ariane-6 successfully,"" he told reporters.', 'Ariane-6 is intended to be a workhorse rocket that gives European governments and companies access to space independently from the rest of the world. It already has a backlog of launch contracts, but there are worries its design could limit future prospects.Like its predecessor, Ariane-5, the new model is expendable - a new rocket is needed for every mission, whereas the latest American vehicles are being built to be wholly or partially reusable.Even so, European space officials believe Ariane-6 can carve out a niche for itself.On the surface, the 6 looks very similar to the old 5, but under the skin it harnesses state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques (3D printing, friction stir welding, augmented reality design, etc) that should result in faster and cheaper production.Ariane-6 will operate in two configurations:The ""62"" will incorporate two solid-fuel side boosters for lifting medium-sized payloadsThe ""64"" will have four strap-on boosters to lift the heaviest satellites on the marketThe core stage is supplemented with a second, or upper, stage that will place the payloads in their precise orbits high above the Earth.This stage has the new capability to be stopped and restarted multiple times, which is useful when launching large batches of satellites into a constellation, or network.', 'Re-ignition should also enable the stage to pull itself back down to Earth, so it won\'t become a piece of lingering space junk.The fact that the inaugural flight was unable to demonstrate this will be a disappointment to engineers, but shouldn\'t hold up the Ariane-6 programme.""A lot of missions do not need to be restarted in microgravity. This is a flexibility we could use or not, and we will adapt the flight profile depending on what we find in the data,"" said Martin Sion, the chief executive of rocket manufacturer ArianeGroup.""And to be 100% clear, we are prepared to make a second launch this year and six next year,"" added Stéphane Israël from Arianespace, the company that markets the new rocket.', ""Inaugural flights are always occasions of high jeopardy. It's not uncommon for a new rocket design to have some sort of anomaly or outright failure.Ariane-5 famously blew itself apart 37 seconds after leaving the ground on its debut in 1996. The loss was put down to an error in control software.But a revised rocket then came back to dominate the commercial launch market for the world's biggest satellites. That dominance was only broken in the 2010s by US entrepreneur Elon Musk and his reusable Falcon-9 rockets.Falcon flight rates and prices undercut the competitiveness of Ariane-5."", 'Europe is moving towards reusability, but the necessary technologies will not be in service until the 2030s. And in the meantime, Mr Musk is introducing even bigger rockets that promise to reduce launch costs still further.Ariane-6 enters a very challenging environment, therefore.""We can all have our own opinions. What I can just reaffirm is that we have an order book that is full,"" said Lucia Linares, who heads space transportation strategy at Esa.""I guess the word goes here to the customers: they have said Ariane-6 is an answer to their needs.""', 'There are launch contracts to take the rocket through its first three years of operations. These include 18 launches for another US billionaire, Jeff Bezos, who wants to establish a constellation of internet satellites he calls Kuiper.European officials aim to have Ariane-6 flying roughly once a month.If this flight rate can be achieved, then the rocket should be able to establish itself, commented Pierre Lionnet from space consultancy ASD Eurospace.""First, we need to ensure that there is sufficient demand from European customers - the European institutional ones. Then Ariane needs to win just a few commercial customers beyond Kuiper. This would give it a market,"" he told BBC News.""But it\'s a matter of pricing.

Satellite captures first-of-a-kind cloud image,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9317wk1v7o#2,A joint European-Japanese mission captures a space view of the internal structure of a cloud.,"Thu, 27 Jun 2024 14:26:50 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.110428,"['A never-seen-before space image of the interior structure of a storm cloud has been released by the European and Japanese space agencies.Their Earthcare satellite used a Doppler radar to capture the view.The data reveals the density of ice, snow, and rain in the cloud, as well as the speed with which these particles are falling to Earth.The novel Earthcare mission was launched in May to better understand how clouds influence the climate.Scientists expect the €850m (£725m) spacecraft\'s observations to also improve weather forecasts.The type of image it produces is routinely acquired by research planes and from ground installations, but not from orbit.""I am absolutely thrilled to see the first radar images from Earthcare - for the first time ever we can measure the fall speeds of ice crystals, raindrops and snowflakes around the whole globe, not just at a handful of ground-based radar stations,"" said Dr Robin Hogan, a mission scientist from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).""This is a great technological achievement: we are using the tiny Doppler shift in the radar echo to infer fall speeds of only around one metre-per-second, and this is from a satellite that is hurtling round its orbit at 7km/s,"" he told BBC News.The sample cloud was observed over the Pacific Ocean, just east of Japan, on 13 June.', 'It\'s possible to see in the image where exactly the different phases of water are being held. Larger particles are in the centre of the cloud.Velocity measurements show the ice crystals and snowflakes are either suspended high up or are falling slowly. There is a clear boundary at an altitude of about 5km where the ice and snow melts, to form water droplets that then fall as rain.In describing the density, distribution by size and movement of the various particles, scientists hope to gain clearer insights into the physics that drives cloud formation and behaviour.One of those sought after insights is the precise role played by clouds in a warming world.Some low-level clouds are known to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight straight back out into space, while others at high altitude work much like a blanket and trap the Sun\'s energy.The Earthcare mission will endeavour to see precisely where the balance lies.This is one of the great uncertainties in the computer models that are used to forecast how the climate will respond to increasing levels of greenhouse gases.""This is only the beginning,"" said Dr Hogan. ""There are three other instruments on Earthcare that are being turned on one-by-one and which, together with the radar, we will use to uncover the mysteries of clouds and their role in the climate system.""Many of the Earthcare team, including myself, have been preparing for the launch of this satellite for over 20 years, so it is unbelievably exciting when the data finally start to arrive,"" he told BBC News.']"
Musk's SpaceX to destroy retired space station,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnl02jl5pzno#2,"The California-based company will build a ""tugboat"" to execute the end-of-life disposal of the ISS.","Thu, 27 Jun 2024 09:18:25 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.110616,"[""Nasa has selected Elon Musk's SpaceX company to bring down the International Space Station at the end of its life.The California-based company will build a vehicle capable of pushing the 430-tonne orbiting platform into the Pacific Ocean early in the next decade.A contract for the work, valued at up to $843m (£668m), was announced on Wednesday.The first elements of the space station were launched in 1998, with continuous crewed operations beginning in 2000.The station circles the Earth every 90 minutes at an altitude just above 400km (250 miles) and has been home to thousands of scientific experiments, investigating all manner of phenomena from the aging process in humans to the formula for new types of materials."", 'Engineers say the laboratory remains structurally sound, but plans need to be put in place now for its eventual disposal.

This decision also supports Nasa\'s plans for future commercial destinations and allows for the continued use of space near Earth,"" Ken Bowersox, the agency\'s director of space operations, said in a statement.The US and Russia lead the ISS project. Europe, Canada and Japan play supporting roles. The western partners have all agreed to fund the station through 2030; Russia says its involvement will extend until at least 2028.', 'Nasa has studied various options for end-of-life disposal.These include disassembling the station and using the younger elements in a next-generation platform. Another idea has been to simply to hand it off to some commercial concern to run and maintain.But these solutions all have varying complications of complexity and cost, as well as the legal difficulty of having to untangle issues of ownership.Neither Nasa nor SpaceX have released details of the design for the de-orbiting ""tug boat"", but it will require considerable thrust to safely guide the station into the atmosphere in the right place and at the right time.The platform\'s great mass and extent - the dimensions roughly of a football pitch - mean some structures and components are bound to survive the heat of re-entry and make it all the way to the surface.Controllers will allow the orbit of the ISS to naturally decay over a period of time, and after removing the last crew will command the tugboat to execute the final de-orbit manoeuvre.Redundant spacecraft are aimed at a remote location in the Pacific known as Point Nemo.Named after the famous submarine sailor from Jules Verne\'s book 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the target graveyard is more than 2,500km from the nearest piece of land.Nasa is hopeful that a number of private consortia will have started launching commercial space stations by the time the ISS is brought out of the sky.The focus of the space agencies will shift to a project to build a platform called Gateway that will orbit the Moon.']"
Who owns the Moon? A new space race means it could be up for grabs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxwwjlrk1mlo#2,A race for the lunar surface's resources is currently under way. What’s to stop a Wild West opening up?,"Sat, 08 Jun 2024 23:58:01 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:34.110833,"['We’re in the midst of a Moon rush. A growing number of countries and companies  have the lunar surface in their sights in a race for resources and space dominance. So are we ready for this new era of lunar exploration?This week, images were beamed back to Earth of China’s flag unfurled on the Moon. It’s the country’s fourth landing there - and the first ever mission to return samples from the Moon’s far side. In the past 12 months, India and Japan have also set down spacecraft on the lunar surface. In February, US firm Intuitive Machines became the first private company to put a lander on the Moon, and there are plenty more set to follow.Meanwhile, Nasa wants to send humans back to the Moon, with its Artemis astronauts aiming for a 2026 landing. China says it will send humans to the Moon by 2030. And instead of fleeting visits, the plan is to build permanent bases.But in an age of renewed great-power politics, this new space race could lead to tensions on Earth being exported to the lunar surface.“Our relationship with the Moon is going to fundamentally change very soon,” warns Justin Holcomb, a geologist from the University of Kansas. The rapidity of space exploration is now “outpacing our laws”, he says.Listen to Rebecca read this article on BBC Sounds.A UN agreement from 1967 says no nation can own the Moon. Instead, the fantastically named Outer Space Treaty says it belongs to everyone, and that any exploration has to be carried out for the benefit of all humankind and in the interests of all nations.While it sounds very peaceful and collaborative - and it is - the driving force behind the Outer Space Treaty wasn’t cooperation, but the politics of the Cold War.As tensions grew between the US and Soviet Union after World War Two, the fear was that space could become a military battleground, so the key part of the treaty was that no nuclear weapons could be sent into space. More than 100 nations signed up. But this new space age looks different to the one back then.', 'One major change is that modern-day Moon missions are not just the projects of nations - companies are competing, too.In January, a US commercial mission called Peregrine announced it was taking human ashes, DNA samples and a sports drink, complete with branding, to the Moon. A fuel leak meant it never made it there, but it sparked debate about how delivering this eclectic inventory fitted in with the treaty’s principle that exploration should benefit all humanity.“We\'re starting to just send stuff up there just because we can. There\'s no sort of rhyme or reason anymore,” says Michelle Hanlon, a space lawyer and founder of For All Moonkind, an organisation that seeks to protect the Apollo landing sites. ""Our Moon is within reach and now we\'re starting to abuse it,” she says.But even if lunar private enterprise is on the increase, nation states still ultimately remain the key players in all this, Sa’id Mosteshar, director of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law, says any company needs to be authorised to go into space by a state, which will be limited by the international treaties.There’s still a great deal of prestige to be had by joining the elite club of Moon landers. After their successful missions, India and Japan could very much claim to be global space players.And a nation with a successful space industry can bring a big boost to the economy through jobs, innovation.But the Moon race offers an even bigger prize: its resources.While the lunar terrain looks rather barren, it contains minerals, including rare earths, metals like iron and titanium - and helium too, which is used in everything from superconductors to medical equipment.Estimates for the value of all this vary wildly, from billions to quadrillions. So it’s easy to see why some see the Moon as a place to make lots of money. However, it’s also important to note that this would be a very long-term investment -  and the tech needed to extract and return these lunar resources is a some way off.In 1979, an international treaty declared that no state or organisation could claim to own the resources there. But it wasn’t popular - only 17 countries are party to it, and this does not include any countries who’ve been to the Moon, including the US.In fact, the US passed a law in 2015 allowing its citizens and industries to extract, use and sell any space material. “This caused tremendous consternation amongst the international community,” Michelle Hanlon told me. “But slowly, others followed suit with similar national laws.” These included Luxembourg, the UAE, Japan and India.The resource that could be most in demand is a surprising one: water.“When the first Moon rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts were analysed, they were thought to be completely dry,” explains Sara Russell, professor of planetary sciences at the Natural History Museum.“But then a kind of revolution happened about 10 years ago, and we found out that they’ve got little traces of water in them trapped in phosphate crystals.”', ""And at the Moon’s poles, she says, there’s even more - reserves of water ice are frozen inside permanently shadowed craters.Future visitors could use the water for drinking, it could be used to generate oxygen and astronauts could even use it to make rocket fuel, by splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen, allowing them to travel from the Moon to Mars and beyond.The US is now attempting to establish a new set of guiding principles around lunar exploration - and lunar exploitation. The so-called Artemis Accords state that extracting and using resources on the Moon should be done in a way complies with the Treaty for Outer Space, although it says some new rules might be needed.More than 40 countries have so far signed up to these non-binding agreements, but China is notably absent from the list. And some argue that new rules for lunar exploration shouldn’t be led by an individual nation.“This really ought to be done through the United Nations because it affects all countries,” Sa’id Mosteshar tells me.But access to resources could also cause another clash.While there’s plenty of room on the Moon, areas close to ice-filled craters are the prime lunar real estate. So what happens if everyone wants the same spot for their future base? And once a country has set one up, what’s to stop another nation establishing their base a bit too close?“I think there's an interesting analogy to the Antarctic,” says Jill Stuart, a space policy and law researcher at the London School of Economics. “We'll probably see research bases being set up on the Moon like they are on the continent.”"", 'But specific decisions about a new lunar base, for example whether it covers a few square kilometres or a few hundred, may come down to whoever gets there first.“There will definitely be a first-mover advantage,” Jill Stuart says.“So if you can get there first and set up camp, then you can work out the size of your zone of exclusion. It doesn’t mean you own that land, but you can sit on that space.”Right now, the first settlers are most likely to be either the US or China, bringing a new layer of rivalry to an already tense relationship. And they are likely to set the standard - the rules established by whoever gets there first may end up being the rules that stick over time.If this all sounds a bit ad hoc, some of the space experts I’ve spoken to think we’re unlikely to see another major international space treaty. The dos and don’ts of lunar exploration are more likely to be figured out with memorandums of understanding or new codes of conduct.There’s a lot at stake. The Moon is our constant companion, as we watch it wax and wane through its various phases as it glows bright in the sky.But as this new space race gets under way, we need to start thinking about what sort of place we want it to be - and whether it risks becoming a setting where very Earthly rivalries are played out.', 'BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Musk to move SpaceX and X HQ over gender identity law,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vd097z7rvo#0,Mr Musk wants to move his two high-profile firms from California to Texas over controversial new law.,"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 09:35:33 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.419977,"['Billionaire Elon Musk has said he will move the headquarters of two of his most high-profile companies, rocket firm SpaceX and social media platform X, from California to Texas.He said the move was due to recent laws passed by the state - in particular a new law which prevents schools from making rules requiring staff tell anyone, including parents, information about a child\'s gender identity.A spokesperson for the governor said the law keeps ""children safe while protecting the critical role of parents"".But Mr Musk called it ""the last straw"" in a post on his social media platform. The billionaire previously moved Tesla\'s headquarters to Texas in 2021 and he is a resident of the state - which has no income tax.The issue of what schools should tell parents about their children\'s gender identities has become a major topic of debate in the US.LGBTQ advocates say students have a right to privacy, but others argue parents have a right to know what is happening with their children. ""It protects the child-parent relationship by preventing politicians and school staff from inappropriately intervening in family matters and attempting to control if, when, and how families have deeply personal conversations,"" Brandon Richards told the Associated Press. Mr Musk, who has a transgender daughter, has previously said he ""supports trans"" while expressing impatience with pronouns - calling them an ""aesthetic nightmare"".The billionaire\'s daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson filed to cut ties with him in 2022.She said she no longer wanted to ""be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form"" when applying to legally change her name and gender.', 'Last year, Mr Musk said he would lobby to criminalise transgender medical treatment.""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" he said in a post on X on Tuesday, noting that he had previously expressed his opposition to the bill.California Governor Gavin Newsom criticised Mr Musk\'s decision on social media. “You bent the knee,” he posted, along with a screenshot of a 2022 post from Donald Trump which said Mr Musk would ""drop to [his] knees and beg"" if he asked.', 'States have historically competed aggressively to woo companies to establish headquarters, bringing with them high-paying corporate jobs. SpaceX, which employs more than 5,000 people in California, according to state records, also already has a large base of operations in Texas. In response to Mr Musk\'s pledge, Greg Abbott, governor for Texas, said: ""This cements Texas as the leader in space exploration.""Neither SpaceX nor X responded to requests for comment about whether the decision to move headquarters would lead to job cuts in California. The move comes after Mr Musk formally endorsed Donald Trump for president following the assassination attempt on him on Saturday.The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Mr Musk would be directing $45m a month toward his campaign.Mr Musk responded on X with a meme implying the report was false, though he later seemed to suggest there was some truth to the claim by responding positively to a post claiming he was pledging millions of dollars to help Trump get elected.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon.']"

"As Apple headset reaches Europe, will VR ever hit the mainstream?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yl7q8z42o#0,"As Apple's Vision Pro headset launches in the UK, can it finally kickstart the virtual reality market?","Sat, 13 Jul 2024 02:02:24 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.420713,"[""To get a sense of the public interest in the Vision Pro, Apple's very high-tech, very expensive virtual reality (VR) headset - finally launched in the UK and Europe on Friday - where better to head than one of its own stores?In the past, people camped outside Apple branches overnight, so desperate were they to get their hands on the tech giant's latest product.When I went to its branch in central London on Friday morning, though, there was just a small group, mainly comprised of men, waiting for the doors to open.Partly, that's because people these days prefer the convenience of pre-orders. But it also perhaps tells us something about the question that continues to hang over the VR headset market: will it ever escape the realm of tech aficionados and go truly mainstream?Apple's plan to make its product break through is to position it as a product you use to do the stuff you already do – only better. Home videos become 3D-like, panoramic photos stretch from floor to ceiling, 360 degrees around you. Apple keeps reminding me it calls this “spatial content”. Nobody else does. Plenty suck their teeth at the Vision Pro's price though - a whopping £3,499.Facebook owner Meta has been watching Apple’s approach closely. It’s been in the VR game a long time. At a recent demo for the Meta Quest 3, which has been available in the UK since 2023, the team was very keen to talk to me about “multi-tasking” – having multiple screens in action at once. In a demo I had a web browser, YouTube and Messenger in a line in front of me. “We always did this, we just didn’t really talk about it,” one Meta worker told me.And in its most recent advertisement, a man wears a Quest 3 to watch video instructions while building a crib. Not the most exciting concept, perhaps, but it shows just how Meta wants people to see its tech.Oh - and it costs less than £500."", 'Apple and Meta are the two big players but VR is a crowded market - there are dozens, maybe hundreds, of different headsets already out there. But what unites them all is none have quite hit the mainstream.Up until now, the Vision Pro has only been on sale in the US - research firm IDC predicts it will shift fewer than 500,000 units this year.Meta, which has been in the market longer, does not release sales data for the Quest either but it\'s thought to have sold around 20 million worldwide.VR headsets are nowhere near as ubiquitous as tablets, let alone mobile phones.And it gets worse - George Jijiashvili, analyst at market research firm Omdia, said of those devices sold, many are abandoned.“This is largely due to the limited in-flow of compelling content to keep up engagement,” he said.But of course lack of content leads to reduced interest - and a reduced incentive for developers to make that content in the first place.""It\'s a chicken and egg situation,"" Mr Jijiashvili told the BBC.Alan Boyce, the founder of mixed reality studio DragonfiAR, warned that early adopters of the Vision Pro would have to “be patient” while more content arrived.That\'s where the Quest 3 wins out for him - it already has a ""robust library"" of games, and it can perform virtual desktop tasks just like the Vision Pro.And IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo says we should not be too quick to write off a slow start for Apple’s new product.“There’s always the expectation that Apple with every single product will sell in the millions straight away, there’s always the comparison with the iPhone,” he said.But the reality is even the iPhone took time to find its feet - and a huge number of buyers.According to Melissa Otto from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the iPhone only became mainstream when the App Store ""started to explode with apps that added value to our lives"".""When people start to feel their lives are becoming better and more convenient, that\'s when they\'re willing to take the leap,"" she said.', 'There is another factor to consider here too though: the physical experience of using a headset.Both Apple and Meta use so-called ""passthrough"" technology to enable what is known as mixed reality - the blending of the real and computer-generated worlds.By utilising cameras on the outside of the headset, users are given a live, high-definition video feed of their surroundings - meaning they can wear it while doing things like walking or exercising.But strapping something to your face weighing half a kilogram is not something that feels particularly natural. Generally headsets now are lighter than before, but I still can’t imagine wearing any of them for hours on end - though a colleague says he often does just this.A sizeable number of people, myself included, have experienced VR sickness, which is when being in VR makes you feel queasy. This has significantly improved as the tech has advanced and is much less of a problem - but any experience that has you moving around with a controller instead of your feet will still take some getting used to. Most VR experiences now include all sorts of settings to avoid this, such as the ability to ""teleport"" between locations. Sony\'s VR game Horizon: Call of the Mountain solved the problem by letting you move by swinging your arms up and down - it sounds silly, but it goes some way to trick the brain and avoid nausea.', 'Whatever the experts say, the companies themselves appear bullish about their products, and their respective strengthsIt’s no secret that the long-term ambition from the tech giants here is for mixed, or augmented, reality to become normal reality. Facebook owner Meta renamed itself after its grand plan for us all to inhabit a virtual world called the Metaverse – working, resting and playing there, and presenting ourselves as digital avatar versions of our ordinary selves. That all seems to have gone a bit quiet at the moment.But they are all right in that one day, something will replace our phones and perhaps that thing is some form of VR headset. Eventually, I expect these things will start to look more like glasses and less like giant ski goggles... if they’re not brain implants (I’m not joking).""The devices that look like what they look like today - I think we know that\'s not a mass market device. It\'s too heavy, it\'s too awkward,"" said Mr Jijiashvili. That\'s an area where rivals have focused their efforts, with Viture and XReal producing sunglasses with high-fidelity screens embedded in them.Melissa Brown, head of Development Relations at Meta, told us she “absolutely” thought the Quest 3 could one day replace the smartphone. But the next day Meta’s PR team got in touch with a more measured response from Mark Zuckerberg, in which he said ""the last generation of computing doesn\'t go away... it\'s not like when we got phones, people stopped using computers"".Judging by what I saw in the Apple store in London’s Regent Street, the UK is not about to be flooded with people wandering around in Vision Pros or Quest 3s. The very first customer I spoke to had actually just popped in for a charger and was a bit bemused by Apple staff applause as he walked in.But in the couple of hours we were there, several people walked out grinning with big white Apple bags. The question remains: how many more can be persuaded to do the same.']"

It said it had found evidence of ""malicious actors"" abusing the system.The investigation began under the EU\'s Digital Services Act (DSA). It could lead to X being fined up to 6% of its global annual turnover and being forced to change how it operates in the bloc.

The ruling is a win for Mr Musk, who purchased Twitter in 2022 and immediately set about making changes, including sacking thousands of staff.The moves sparked multiple lawsuits from former staff and vendors, accusing the company of withholding payments that had been promised.This complaint was filed in 2023 in a federal court in San Francisco by Courtney McMillian, the former ""head of total rewards"" at the social media site, which Mr Musk renamed X.In the complaint, she said the firm had provided staff only one month\'s worth of pay as severance instead of the far more generous benefits, including at least two months of salary and contributions toward health insurance, that had been promised.Mr Musk\'s team had urged the judge to reject the complaint, saying that America\'s Employee Retirement Income Security Act did not apply as claimed.

On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: ""We have won the war on floppy disks!""Mr Kono has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would ""get rid of the fax machine"". Once seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change.For instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback. The announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a ""symbol of an anachronistic administration"". ""The government still uses floppy disks? That\'s so outdated... I guess they\'re just full of old people,"" read another comment on X. Others comments were more nostalgic. “I wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,” one user wrote.Created in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented.

More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information.Sony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011. As part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads. But Japan\'s efforts to digitise may be easier said than done.

If it fails to comply it will face a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,935).The company\'s updated policy was also the focus of scrutiny in the UK and the European Union (EU). Under its privacy policy changes, which were due to take effect in the region on 26 June, Meta users\' information would be used to ""develop and improve"" its AI products. In Europe, the policy change would include posts, images, image captions, comments and Stories that users over the age of 18 had shared with a public audience on Facebook and Instagram, but not private messages.But that was put on hold after Meta said it had received a request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) on behalf of other European stakeholders to delay its training of large language models (LLMs).LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence that powers chatbots, such as OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and Google\'s Gemini. On 14 June, when it announced the delay, Meta said this was a ""step backwards"" for AI in Europe.However Meta decided to press ahead with the policy change in Brazil.Pedro Martins, from Data Privacy Brasil, welcomed the ANPD\'s decision. He told the BBC there was a discrepancy between Meta\'s data protection measures for its Brazilian and European users.Meta had planned to use posts from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, he said, while in Europe nobody under 18 would have their posts used.Brazil\'s data protection regulator also found that personal data found in children and teenagers\' posts could be collected and used to train Meta\'s AI systems, which could be in breach of the country\'s data protection law.In addition, Mr Martins said, in Europe the steps users can take to prevent Meta from using personal information are more straightforward than in Brazil, where he said it can take as many as eight steps for users to block the company from using their posts.The BBC has asked Meta to respond to the claim that it had planned to use posts  from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, and whether it imposed more onerous steps for opting out on users in Brazil.

How Microsoft and Nvidia bet correctly to leapfrog Apple,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nglq80w7eo#2,The two tech firms were among the first to see the commercial potential of AI.,"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 23:05:03 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.423069,"['Life comes at you fast.Last month, AI chip giant Nvidia briefly became the world’s richest company, overtaking Microsoft, which had in turn risen above Apple.When this news was mentioned on stage at a tech industry event I attended in Copenhagen, there was spontaneous applause from the audience.As I write, Nvidia is now back in second place, after a fall in its share price took its combined value down to $3tn (£2.4tn) compared with $3.4tn for Microsoft.Two things have propelled these two US tech titans to such a dizzying pinnacle: AI and foresight.Microsoft started investing in OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019. Meanwhile, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang pushed his company towards AI chip development many years before generative AI exploded onto the scene.Both firms took a long-term bet on the current AI boom – and so far, it’s paid off, leaving former top-dog Apple trailing in their wake. But how long will it last?', 'This year’s London Tech Week, an annual event for the UK tech scene, may as well have been called London AI Week. The letters AI were emblazoned on every stand, and uttered in every speech.I bumped into Anne Boden, the founder of Starling Bank, a significant fintech disruptor. She was buzzing with excitement.“We thought we knew who the winners and losers were [in tech],” she told me. “But with AI, we are throwing the dice again”.She believes she’s watching the AI revolution re-landscape the tech sector, and she wants to dive back in.That same week I also popped along to Founders Forum, an annual gathering of around 250 high-level entrepreneurs and investors. Some serious money, in other words. It’s a confidential event, but I don’t think I’ll get into too much trouble for saying that much of the chat there was also centred around AI.A few days after that, a headline in the Financial Times caught my eye. “Most stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,” it read, claiming that more than half of the stocks in Citigroup’s “AI winners basket” had fallen in value in 2024.Life comes at you fast indeed.', '“Given how high valuations have leapt for tech companies, missteps ahead could cause big wobbles in share prices,” warns Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.“Just like the dot.com bubble, over-enthusiasm risks spilling over into disappointment.”In 2023 you’d have been forgiven for thinking that anything with the acronym AI in it was guaranteed to open up a lucrative seam of funding, with investment dollars flooding into all things AI.My friend Saurabh Dayal, who is based in Scotland, identifies AI projects for his pharmaceutical firm to potentially collaborate on. He said he soon grew tired of misleading pitches.“I spend a lot of time saying ‘… but that’s not AI’,” he tells me.It seems both investors and clients are finally growing wiser to the term AI, and, as a result, more picky.', 'Speaking to the FT, Citi’s Stuart Kaiser said that while AI remained a big theme in the world of stocks and shares, “just saying AI 15 times isn’t going to cut it anymore”.In addition, there is increased awareness of current generative AI products not exactly living up to their own hype. Inaccuracies, misinformation, displays of bias, copyright infringements and some content that’s just plain weird.And early AI-enabled physical devices like the Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin have received bad reviews.“We’re seeing the market around generative AI mature a little right now – early experiments set a lot of grand expectations, but when the rubber hit the road there were too many unexpected outcomes,” says Chris Weston, chief digital and information officer of the tech service firm Jumar.“Businesses have a lot of value tied up in goodwill – the trust and comfort that their clients have in their services. Introducing ungovernable chatbots is a step too far for many right now.”Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore agrees that the pressure is on for AI firms to deliver on their promises. “The bubble will burst the moment one of the giants fails to show any meaningful growth from AI,” he says.But he does not believe that is going to happen any time soon.“Everyone is still jostling for position, and all companies are pinning their strategies on AI,” he adds.“All the players are ramping up their activities, increasing spend and claiming early successes.”', ""There’s another reason why the AI bubble might pop. It’s got nothing to do with the quality of the products or their market value. It’s whether the planet itself can afford it.A study published last year predicted that the AI industry could consume the same amount of energy of a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027 if growth continues at its current rate.I interviewed Prof Kate Crawford from the University of Southern California for the BBC’s Tech Life podcast, and she told me that worrying about the amount of electricity, energy and water required to power AI kept her awake at night. Dr Sasha Luccioni from the machine-learning firm Hugging Face is also concerned.“There’s simply not enough renewable energy to power AI right now – most of that bubble is fuelled by oil and gas,” she says.The hope is that the tech could be used to identify sustainability solutions, like for example the secret of nuclear fusion, the way in which the sun gets its energy. But that hasn’t happened yet, and in the meantime, “AI systems put a huge strain on energy grids that are already under immense strain,” adds Dr Luccioni.With so much uncertainty, few should bet against another shake-up among the world's richest firms. But currently, Apple has a fight on its hands to catch up with Microsoft and Nvidia in the AI race.""]"
VW to invest up to $5bn in Tesla rival Rivian,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ddmxmz1lpo#2,Shares in the US-based electric truck and SUV maker jumped by almost 50% after the announcement.,"Wed, 26 Jun 2024 01:41:00 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.423179,"['German car making giant Volkswagen (VW) says it will invest up to $5bn (£3.94bn) in Tesla rival Rivian.The deal creates a joint venture that will allow VW and the US-based electric vehicle (EV) maker to share technology.Rivian shares jumped by almost 50% after the announcement.The tie-up comes as competition intensifies between EV makers and Western countries move to impose tariffs on Chinese imports.Under the agreement, VW said it will initially invest $1bn in the electric truck and SUV maker, with another $4bn to be put into the company by 2026.Founded in 2009, Rivian has not yet posted a quarterly profit. In the first three months of 2024 the company saw a net loss of more than $1.4bn.VW, like other motor industry giants, has come under pressure from rivals like Tesla and China\'s BYD as it tries to make the shift from fossil fuel-powered vehicles.Meanwhile, some EV start-ups have struggled to make headway in the highly competitive market and as higher interest rates hit demand for big ticket purchases.The partnership will give VW immediate access to Rivian\'s software allowing the German car maker to use it in its cars. Motor industry giants like VW have also been facing growing competition from Chinese EV makers, which have been expanding globally.Earlier this month, the European Union (EU) warned that it will raise tariffs on Chinese EV imports by as much as 38%.Officials from China and the EU have held talks ahead of a 4 July deadline.A months-long investigation by the European Commission found that Chinese EV companies had been ""unfairly subsidised"".In response, China said the tariffs violated international trade rules and described the investigation as ""protectionism"".The plan came just a month after the US said it will increase import levies on Chinese EVs from 25% to 100%.This week, Canada said that it was considering a similar move to align itself with allies.Separately on Tuesday, Tesla said it would recall most of its Cybertrucks sold in the US over issues with their windscreen wipers and exterior trim.The recalls cover more than 11,000 of the vehicles, which first went on sale at the end of November last year.']"

Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Udio said in a blog post on Tuesday it was ""completely uninterested in reproducing content"".The lawsuits, announced on Monday by the Recording Industry Association of America, are part of a wave of lawsuits from authors, news organisations and other groups that are challenging the rights of AI firms to use their work.Suno, which is based in Massachusetts, released its first product last year and claims more than 10 million people have used its tool to make music.  The company, which has a partnership with Microsoft, charges a monthly fee for its service and recently announced it had raised $125m from investors.New York-based Udio, known as Uncharted Labs, is backed by high-profile venture capital investors such as Andreessen Horowitz.

A part of the roof had collapsed.South Korea is a leading producer of lithium batteries, which are used in many items from electric vehicles to laptops.Fire official Kim Jin-young said 18 Chinese, one Laotian and two South Korean workers had been confirmed as among the dead. A final body had yet to be identified, and there are fears at least one more person may be missing.""Most of the bodies are badly burned so it will take some time to identify each one,"" Mr Kim said, according to news agency AFP.A further eight people were injured - two seriously - out of the 100 who had been working when the fire broke out.The Aricell factory housed an estimated 35,000 battery cells on its second floor, where the batteries were inspected and packaged, with more stored elsewhere.Mr Kim said the fire began when a series of battery cells exploded, though it remains unclear what triggered the initial explosions.He explained it was difficult to enter the site initially ""due to fears of additional explosions"".It is not yet clear what started the blaze. Lithium batteries are at risk of exploding if they are damaged or overheated.

The platform knows when to plant, and when the crop will start flowering and producing seed.”One of the biggest problems facing the seed industry is how to launch climate resilient seeds to market faster and cheaper, says Himanshu Gupta, chief executive of San Francisco-based ClimateAi.“By the time some seed companies do this, in say 10 to 15 years, the climate has already changed,” says Mr Gupta. “We are running against time to launch new seed varieties.”He says that ClimateAi helps these firms to see how specific test seeds have performed in a particular region or locality. “This can help seed companies figure out the optimal locations for growing seeds.”', 'Last year, a study published in scientific journal Nature warned of the potentially dire consequences of numerous crop failures happening at the same time around the world, as a result of the impact of climate change.“Simultaneous harvest failures across major crop-producing regions are a threat to global food security,” said the report, which was led by climate scientist Kai Kornhuber from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.This warning comes as the world population is expected to reach 10 billion people by 2050, up from eight billion currently, according to the United Nations.With increased pressure on crops, at the same time as the global population continues to grow, could AI be key to developing new varieties that can better cope with extremes of weather?', 'In the city of Arusha in Tanzania, David Guerena, agricultural scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, is leading a project called Artemis.Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, this is using AI to help breed more resilient crops. Specifically the AI is helping speed up work called phenotyping.This is the visual studying of new crop varieties based on observations of their characteristics, such as how many flowers, pods or leaves that a plant has.“Traditionally it takes around 10 years to develop a new crop variety,” explains Mr Guerena. “But given the pace of climate change, this timeframe is no longer viable.""He adds that the phenotyping work traditionally relied on the human eye. “But humans are just not doing this consistently, with the high levels of precision necessary, to make subtle, yet important, plant selections,” says Mr Guerena.“It can be over 30˚C in the field. It’s just tiring, and fatigue affects data quality.”Instead, growers involved in the project are taking photos of their crops through an app on a smartphone.  The trained AI can then quickly analyses, records, and reports what it sees.“Computers can count every flower or pod, from every plant, every day without getting tired,” says Mr Guerena. “This is really important as the number of flowers in bean plants correlate to the number of pods which directly influence yields.“Data can be so complicated, to understand what’s happening, but AI can be used to make sense of that complicated data and pick up patterns, show where we need resources, show recommendations.“Our plant breeders estimate that with the better data from the AI computer vision they may be able to shorten the breeding cycle to only a few years.”', 'In North Carolina, Avalo is an agriculture technology or “agri-tech” business also working to create climate-resilient crops. It does this by using AI to help study a crop’s genetics.“Our process starts with genomic data about crops, for example, the sequences of various varieties,” says Rebecca White, Avalo’s chief operating officer.“For example, with different tomatoes, there’s some small differences in genomes that give them different traits, for example different flavours, pesticide-resilient profiles. Our machine-learning programme is able to take these small differences across a number of varieties and see which genomes are important for what traits.”Using their tech they have been able to create a broccoli that matures in a greenhouse in 37 days rather than the standard 45 to 60 days, says Ms White.“Broccoli produced on that timescale can get additional growth cycles, and it saves carbon footprint and improves the environmental impact.”Avalo, which works with companies in Asia and North America, is also working to make rice resistant to frost, and potatoes more tolerant to drought.“Our core technologies can identify the genetic basis of complex traits with minimal training and, via sequencing and predictive analysis, quickly and inexpensively assess and model new plant varieties,” says Ms White.“We are creating new varieties for diverse crops that are developed five-times faster and for a fraction of the cost compared to traditional breeding.”', 'However, while AI can help mitigate the impact of climate-related weather, and enhance crop resilience, there are a number of challenges when it comes to using AI in agriculture, says Kate E Jones, professor of ecology and biodiversity at University College London.“The effectiveness of AI in ensuring food security also depends on addressing challenges such as data quality, technology accessibility… while acknowledging that AI is one tool among many in a comprehensive strategy for sustainable and resilient agriculture.”']"

How AI is fuelling uncertainty for game developers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl44mv0jnv5o#4,In a struggling games industry AI has been hailed as a possible saviour. But not everyone's convinced.,"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 23:05:46 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.426212,"['""I\'m very aware that I could wake up tomorrow and my job could be gone,” says Jess Hyland.The video game artist says the industry she’s spent almost 15 years working in is on “shaky” ground at the moment.A boom in players and profits during the pandemic sparked a flurry of investments, expansions and acquisitions that, in hindsight, now look short-sighted.Gaming remains profitable, but thousands of workers worldwide have lost their jobs, and successful studios have been shut down over the past two years.More closures and cuts are feared.""Everyone knows someone who\'s been laid off. There\'s lots of worry about the future,"" says Jess.Some bosses are talking up the potential of generative AI - the tech behind tools such as ChatGPT - as a potential saviour.Tech giant Nvidia has shown off impressive development tool prototypes, and gaming industry heavyweights such as Electronic Arts and Ubisoft are investing in the tech.It\'s claimed AI tools can save development time, free workers up to focus on creativity and provide a more personalised user experience.With budgets at the blockbuster end of the industry spiralling as audience expectations rise with them, it sounds like a perfect solution.But not to everyone.', '""The people who are most excited about AI enabling creativity aren\'t creatives,"" says Jess, a member of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain\'s game workers branch. She sits on its artificial intelligence working group. Against the backdrop of widespread layoffs, Jess says the suspicion among workers is that bosses see AI as a path to cutting costs when labour is their biggest expense.Jess says she knows one person who\'s lost work due to AI, and has heard of it happening to others.There are also dozens of accounts online suggesting that jobs in concept art and other traditionally entry-level roles have been affected.Most firms making AI tools insist they\'re not designed to replace humans, and there\'s broad agreement that the technology is a long way from being able to do so.Jess says the bigger worry is that ""jobs are going to change, but not in a good way"".Rather than creating their own material, says Jess, artists worry they could end up supplementing AI\'s efforts, rather than the other way around.', 'Publicly available AI image generators, for example, can quickly output impressive-looking results from simple text prompts, but are famously poor at rendering hands. They can also struggle with chairs.""The stuff that AI generates, you become the person whose job is fixing it,"" says Jess. ""It\'s not why I got into making games."" Gaming is a multibillion-dollar business but it\'s also an artistic medium that brings together artists, musicians, writers, programmers and actors, to name just some.A frequent concern is that AI will serve to minimise, rather than enable, the work of those creatives.', 'It\'s a view echoed by Chris Knowles, a former senior engine developer at UK gaming firm Jagex, known for its Runescape title.""If you\'re going to have to hire actual human artists to fix the output, why not harness their creativity and make something new that connects with players?"" he says.Chris, who now runs UK indie studio Sidequest Ninja, says that in his experience smaller developers are generally unenthusiastic about using generative AI.One of his concerns is around cloned games.Online game stores - where indie developers make most of their sales - are rife with imitations of original titles. This is especially true of mobile games, says Chris, and there are studios set up ""entirely to churn out clones"".It\'s not yet possible to rip off a whole game using AI, he says, but copying assets such as artwork is easily done.""Anything that makes the clone studios\' business model even cheaper and quicker makes the difficult task of running a financially sustainable indie studio even harder,"" says Chris. He also points to the huge amounts of electricity required to run generative AI systems as a big concern. ', 'Copyright concerns over generative AI - currently the subject of several ongoing legal cases - are one of the biggest barriers to its wider use in gaming right now.Tools are trained on vast quantities of text and pictures scraped from the internet and, like many artists, Jess believes it amounts to ""mass copyright infringement"".Some studios are exploring systems trained on internal data, and third parties advertising ethical tools that claim to work off authorised sources are springing up.Even then, the fear is that AI will be used to turn out assets such as artwork and 3D models at scale, and the expectation on workers will be to produce more output.""The more content you can make, the more money you can make,"" says Jess.', 'Some in the industry are more positive about AI.Composer Borislav Slavov, who won a Bafta Games Award for his work on Baldur\'s Gate 3, told the BBC he was ""excited about what AI could bring to the table for music in the near future"".Speaking at the recent Games Music Festival in London, he said he believed it would enable composers to ""explore music directions faster"" and push them out of their comfort zones.""This would allow the composers to focus way more on the essence - getting inspired and composing deeply emotional and strong themes,"" he said.However, he did agree that AI could not ""replace the human soul and spirit"".While she has serious personal reservations about using the tech to ""automate creativity"", Jess says she wouldn\'t be against using it to bear the burden of some of the more repetitive admin tasks that are a feature of most projects.', 'The AI industry is currently trying to reassure governments and regulators over concerns about its future use, as shown by a recent law passed by the EUIt will also have to work hard to win over another group - gamers.Online shooter The Finals received a backlash over its use of synthesised voice lines, and developer Square Enix was criticised for the limited use of generated art in its multiplayer game Foamstars.Jess believes growing talk about AI has made gamers ""think about what they love about games and what\'s special about that - sharing experiences crafted by other humans"".""I\'m still putting something of myself into it and I think there\'s a growing recognition of that.""Indie developer Chris adds: ""If you train a generative model on nothing but cave paintings, all it\'ll ever give you will be cave paintings. ""It takes humans to get from there to the Sistine Chapel.""Additional reporting by Laura Cress.']"
Why both businesses and scammers love India's payment system,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c288m1km01po#4,"Fast and free, India's UPI payments system has been a big success, but has attracted scammers.","Thu, 11 Jul 2024 21:14:58 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.426388,"['Every day, for the last seven years, Arun Kumar has set up his fruit stall on a busy Mumbai street.It\'s not an easy way to make a living.“Being a street vendor is a challenge. There\'s the fear of being robbed or, as I am not a licensed vendor, the local body can come and dismantle my store anytime,"" he says.But over the past four years at least one aspect of his work has become easier. “Prior to Covid everything was in cash. But now everyone pays with UPI. Scan the code and the payment is done within seconds.""No issues of handling cash, giving change to customers. It has made my life and business smooth,” he says.', ""UPI, or to give it its full name the Unified Payments Interface, was launched in 2016  in a collaboration between India's central bank and the nation's banking industry.It's an app-based instant payment system, which allows users to send and receive money, pay bills and authorise payments in a single step - no need to enter bank details or any other personal information. And, perhaps most importantly, it's free.It has become so popular that India is now the biggest real-time payments market.In May, UPI recorded 14 billion transactions, up from nine billion the year before. "", 'But the popularity and ease of use has made it a rich feeding ground for scammers.“While digital payments are convenient, they do come with vulnerabilities,"" says Shashank Shekhar, founder of the Delhi-based Future Crime Research Foundation.Mr Shekhar says that scammers use a variety of ways to trick people, including persuading them to share their UPI pin number, which is needed to authorise payments.Some scammers have also created fake UPI apps, that are clones of legitimate banking apps, and then steal login details or other valuable information.""The pace at which digital transformation took place in the country means unfortunately digital literacy and safe internet practice could not catch up,"" says Mr Shekhar.He says that between January 2020 and June 2023 almost half of all financial fraud involved the use of the UPI system.According to government figures there were more than 95,000 cases of fraud involving UPI in the financial year ending April 2023, up from 77,000 in the previous year.', 'Shivkali was one such victim. She had always wanted to own a scooter, but they were beyond her budget.However, earlier in the year the 22-year-old, who lives in Bihar state in northeastern India, spotted one for sale on Facebook that looked like a great deal.""I grabbed the opportunity without thinking,"" she says. A couple of clicks later and she was talking to the owner, who said that for $23 he would send over the vehicle papers.That went smoothly, so Shivkali continued to send the owner money, via instant transfers. She eventually ended up paying $200, but the scooter (also commonly called a Scooty in India), was never delivered.Shivkali realised she had been scammed.""I did not think I could be cheated, as I have some education background and know what is happing in the world. But scammers are smart. They have an art of speaking to convince the opposite person,” she says.The government and the central bank are looking at ways to protect UPI users from scammers.But at the moment, if a victim wants compensation, they have to approach their bank.“The problem is deep rooted,"" says Dr Durgesh Pandey, an expert in financial crime.""Most of the onus lies with banks and telecom companies. They are lax in making identity checks, that’s why the fraudster can’t be traced.""But the challenge for banks particularly is that they have to balance between inclusivity, ease of business and enforcement of identity checks. If they are too rigid, the vulnerable section of society will remain without banking facilities.”But Dr Pandey argues that in most cases of fraud, the bank is not totally to blame.“It’s a complex question because the problem lies with banks, but it’s the victim who is giving his credentials in most case. I would say both victim and bank should bear the loss.”', 'Despite those problems, UPI is being promoted in rural areas where access to banking services can be difficult.Poonam Untwal from Rajasthan runs a guidance centre which helps people use the internet and digital banking.""Most of us are not that educated, nor know the proper use of smartphones. I teach them that phones are no longer a device just to talk to people but banks at their fingertips,"" she says.She believes that UPI will help develop the local economy.""Many women like me have a small business that we run from our home. Now we can receive and send money with UPI. People who don’t have smart phones come to my centre to get their transactions done,"" she says.As well as making inroads into rural areas, UPI is spreading overseas.Retailers in Bhutan, Mauritius, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and UAE will take UPI payments. And this year, France become the first European country to accept UPI payments, starting with tickets to the Eiffel Tower.', 'Back in Mumbai, Mr Kumar is happy that he no longer has to use cash, but remains wary.If he can\'t get a good internet connection then customers can, by accident or design, make off without paying. ""For a small vendor like me it [UPI] made receiving money very easy. But I am always scared of fraud. I keep hearing in the news how the UPI frauds are increasing. Hopefully some mechanisms are invented so a small vendor like me doesn’t face losses.”']"
Will K-pop's AI experiment pay off?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngr3r0914o#4,"Some of the genre's biggest names are now using artificial intelligence, but fans are divided.","Tue, 16 Jul 2024 08:31:00 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.426507,"['There’s an issue dividing K-pop fans right now - artificial intelligence.Several of the genre’s biggest stars have now experimented with the technology to create music videos and produce songs, including boy band Seventeen.Last year the South Korean group sold around 16 million albums, making them one of the most successful K-pop acts in history. But it’s their most recent album and single, Maestro, that’s got people talking.The music video features an AI-generated scene, and at the launch of the album in Seoul, one of the band members, Woozi, told reporters he was ""experimenting"" with AI when making music.“We practised making songs with AI, as we want to develop along with technology rather than complain about it,"" he said.""This is a technological development that we have to leverage, not just be dissatisfied with. I practised using AI and tried to look for the pros and cons.”However, Woozi has since said on Instagram that all of Seventeen\'s music is “written and composed by human creators”.', 'On K-pop discussion pages, fans were torn over the issue of using AI, with some saying more regulations need to be in place before the technology becomes normalised.Others were more open to it, including super fan Ashley Peralta. ""If AI can help an artist overcome creative blocks, then that’s OK with me,"" says the 26-year-old.Her worry though, is that a whole album of AI generated lyrics means fans will lose touch with their favourite musicians.""I love it when music is a reflection of an artist and their emotions,"" she says. ""K-pop artists are much more respected when they’re hands on with choreographing, lyric writing and composing, because you get a piece of their thoughts and feelings.""AI can take away that crucial component that connects fans to the artists.""Ashley presents Spill the Soju, a K-pop fan podcast, with her best friend Chelsea Toledo. Chelsea admires Seventeen for being a self-producing group, which means they write their own songs and choreograph them too, but she’s worried about AI having an impact on that reputation.“If they were to put out an album that’s full of lyrics they hadn’t personally written, I don’t know if it would feel like Seventeen any more and fans want music that is authentically them”.', ""For those working in K-Pop production, it’s no surprise that artists are embracing new technologies.Chris Nairn is a producer, composer and songwriter working under the name Azodi. Over the past 12 years he’s written songs for K-pop artists including Kim Woojin and leading agency SM Entertainment.Working with K-pop stars means Chris, who lives in Brighton, has spent a lot of time in South Korea, whose music industry he describes as progressive.“What I've learned by hanging out in Seoul is that Koreans are big on innovation, and they're very big on ‘what's the next thing?’, and asking, ‘how can we be one step ahead?’ It really hit me when I was there,” he says.“So, to me, it's no surprise that they're implementing AI in lyric writing, it's about keeping up with technology.”"", 'Is AI the future of K-pop? Chris isn’t so sure. As someone who experiments with AI lyric generators, he doesn’t feel the lyrics are strong enough for top artists.“AI is putting out fairly good quality stuff, but when you\'re at the top tier of the songwriting game, generally, people who do best have innovated and created something brand new. AI works by taking what’s already been uploaded and therefore can’t innovate by itself.”If anything, Chris predicts AI in K-pop will increase the demand for more personal songs.""There\'s going to be pressure from fans to hear lyrics that are from the artist\'s heart, and therefore sound different to any songs made using AI”.', 'Seventeen aren’t the only K-pop  band experimenting with AI. Girl group Aespa, who have several AI members as well as human ones, also used the technology in their latest music video. Supernova features generated scenes where the faces of band members remain still as only their mouths move.Podcaster and super-fan Chelsea says it ""triggered"" a lot of people.“K-pop is known for amazing production and editing, so having whole scenes made of AI takes away the charm,"" she adds.Chelsea also worries about artists not getting the right credit. “With AI in videos it’s harder to know if someone’s original artwork has been stolen, it’s a really touchy subject”.', ""Arpita Adhya is a music journalist and self-titled K-pop superfan. She believes the use of AI in the industry is demonstrative of the pressure artists are under to create new content.“Most recording artists will put out an album every two years, but K-pop groups are pushing out albums every six to eight months, because there’s so much hype around them.”She also believes AI has been normalised in the industry, with the introduction of AI covers which have exploded on YouTube. The cover tracks are created by fans and use technology to mimic another artist's voice.It's this kind of trend that Arpita would like to see regulated, something western artists are calling for too."", 'Just last month megastars including Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj wrote an open letter calling for the ""predatory"" use of AI in the music industry to be stopped.They called on tech firms to pledge not to develop AI music-generation tools ""that undermine or replace the human artistry of songwriters and artists, or deny us fair compensation for our work"".For Arpita, a lack of regulations means fans feel an obligation to regulate what is and isn’t OK.“Whilst there are no clear guidelines on how much artists can and can’t use AI, we have the struggle of making boundaries ourselves, and always asking ‘what is right and wrong?’”Thankfully she feels K-pop artists are aware of public opinion and hopes there will be change.“The fans are the biggest part and they have a lot of influence over artists. Groups are always keen to learn and listen, and if Seventeen and Aespa realise they are hurting their fans, they will hopefully address that.”Update 14 July 2024: This article was amended to confirm that while AI is being experimented with in K-pop, it was not used to write songs for the latest Seventeen album.']"
Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5l6vnvqjo#4,Can Amazon sustain its rapid growth since 1994 - or will rivals or regulators cut it down to size?,"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 12:02:30 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.426622,"['Three decades on from the day it began, it is hard to get your head around the scale of Amazon.Consider its vast warehouse in Dartford, on the outskirts of London. It has millions of stock items, with hundreds of thousands of them bought every day - and it takes two hours from the moment something is ordered, the company says, for it to be picked, packed and sent on its way.Now, picture that scene and multiply it by 175. That\'s the number of ""fulfilment centres"", as Amazon likes to call them, that it has around the world.Even if you think you can visualise that never-ending blur of parcels crisscrossing the globe, you need to remember something else: that\'s just a fraction of what Amazon does.It is also a major streamer and media company (Amazon Prime Video); a market leader in home camera systems (Ring) and smart speakers (Alexa) and tablets and e-readers (Kindle); it hosts and supports vast swathes of the internet (Amazon Web Services); and much more besides.""For a long time it has been called \'The Everything Store\', but I think, at this point, Amazon is sort of \'The Everything Company\',"" Bloomberg\'s Amanda Mull tells me.""It\'s so large and so omnipresent and touches so many different parts of life, that after a while, people sort of take Amazon\'s existence in all kinds of elements of daily life sort of as a given,"" she says.Or, as the company itself once joked, pretty much the only way you could get though a day without enriching Amazon in some way was by ""living in a cave"".', 'So the story of Amazon, since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, has been one of explosive growth, and continual reinvention.There has been plenty of criticism along the way too, over ""severe"" working conditions and how much tax it pays.But the main question as it enters its fourth decade appears to be: once you are The Everything Company, what do you do next?Or as Sucharita Kodali, who analyses Amazon for research firm Forrester, puts it: ""What the heck is left?""""Once you\'re at a half a trillion dollars in revenue, which they already are, how do you continue to grow at double digits year over year?""One option is to try to tie the threads between existing businesses: the vast amounts of shopping data Amazon has for its Prime members might help it sell adverts on its streaming service, which - like its rivals - is increasingly turning to commercials for revenue.But that only goes so far - what benefits can Kuiper, its satellite division, bring to Whole Foods, its supermarket chain?To some extent, says Sucharita Kodali, the answer is to ""keep taking swings"" at new business ventures, and not worry if they fall flat.Just this week Amazon killed a business robot line after only nine months - Ms Kodali says that it is just one of a ""whole graveyard of bad ideas"" the company tried and discarded in order to find the successful ones.But, she says, Amazon may also have to focus on something else: the increasing attention of regulators, asking difficult questions like what does it do with our data, what environmental impact is it having, and is it simply too big?All of these issues could prompt intervention ""in the same way that we rolled back the monopolies that became behemoths in the early 20th century"", Ms Kodali says.For Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, its size poses another problem: the places its Western customers live in simply can not take much more stuff.""Our cities were not built for many more deliveries,"" he tells the BBC.That makes emerging economies like India, Mexico and Brazil important. But, Mr Kaziukėnas, suggests, there Amazon does not just need to enter the market but to some extent to make it.""It\'s crazy and maybe should not be the case - but that\'s a conversation for another day,"" he says.', 'Amanda Mull points to another priority for Amazon in the years ahead: staving off competition from Chinese rivals like Temu and Shein.Amazon, she says, has ""created the spending habits"" of western consumers by acting as a trusted intermediary between them and Chinese manufacturers, and bolting on to that easy returns and lightning fast delivery.But remove that last element of the deal and you can bring prices down, as the Chinese retailers have done.""They have said \'well, if you wait a week or 10 days for something that you\'re just buying on a lark, we can give it to you for almost nothing,\'"" says Ms Mull - a proposition that is appealing to many people, especially during a cost of living crisis.Juozas Kaziukėnas is not so sure - suggesting the new retailers will remain ""niche"", and it will take something much more fundamental to challenge Amazon\'s position.""For as long as going shopping involves going to a search bar - Amazon has nailed that,"" he says.Thirty years ago a fledging company spotted emerging trends around internet use and realised how it could upend first retail, then much else besides.Mr Kaziukėnas says for that to happen again will take a similar leap of imagination, perhaps around AI.""The only threat to Amazon is something that doesn\'t look like Amazon,"" he says.']"
Is AI the answer for better government services?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmllxl89jlwo#4,Governments are experimenting with AI chatbots that can give help and advice.,"Mon, 08 Jul 2024 23:01:47 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.426735,"['Long before ChatGPT came along, governments were keen to use chatbots to automate their services and advice.Those early chatbots ""tended to be simpler, with limited conversational abilities,"" says Colin van Noordt, a researcher on the use of AI in government, and based in the Netherlands.But the emergence of generative AI in the last two years, has revived a vision of more efficient public service, where human-like advisors can work all hours, replying to questions over benefits, taxes and other areas where the government interacts with the public.Generative AI is sophisticated enough to give human-like responses, and if trained on enough quality data, in theory it could deal with all sorts of questions about government services.But generative AI has become well known for making mistakes or even nonsensical answers - so-called hallucinations.', 'In the UK, the Government Digital Service (GDS) has carried out tests on a ChatGPT-based chatbot called GOV.UK Chat, which would answer citizens\' questions on a range of issues concerning government services.In a blog post about their early findings, the agency noted that almost 70% of those involved in the trial found the responses useful.However, there were problems with ""a few"" cases of the system generating incorrect information and presenting it as fact.The blog also raised concern that there might be misplaced confidence in a system that could be wrong some of the time.“Overall, answers did not reach the highest level of accuracy demanded for a site like GOV.UK, where factual accuracy is crucial. We’re rapidly iterating this experiment to address the issues of accuracy and reliability.""', 'Other countries are also experimenting with systems based on generative AI.Portugal released the Justice Practical Guide in 2023, a chatbot devised to answer basic questions on simple subjects such as marriage and divorce. The chatbot has been developed with funds from the European Union’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).The €1.3m ($1.4m; £1.1m) project is based on OpenAI’s GPT 4.0 language model. As well as covering marriage and divorce, it also provides information on setting-up a company.According to data by the Portuguese Ministry of Justice, 28,608 questions were posed through the guide in the project’s first 14 months.When I asked it the basic question: ""How can I set up a company,"" it performed well.But when I asked something trickier: ""Can I set up a company if I am younger than 18, but married?"", it apologised for not having the information to answer that question.A ministry source admits that they are still lacking in terms of trustworthiness, even though wrong replies are rare.“We hope these limitations will be overcome with a decisive increase in the answers’ level of confidence”, the source tells me.', 'Such flaws mean that many experts are advising caution – including Colin van Noordt. “It goes wrong when the chatbot is deployed as a way to replace people and reduce costs.""It would be a more sensible approach, he adds, if they\'re seen as ""an additional service, a quick way to find information”.Sven Nyholm, professor of the ethics of artificial intelligence at Munich’s Ludwig Maximilians University, highlights the problem of accountability.“A chatbot is not interchangeable with a civil servant,"" he says. ""A human being can be accountable and morally responsible for their actions.""AI chatbots cannot be accountable for what they do. Public administration requires accountability, and so therefore it requires human beings.”Mr Nyholm also highlights the problem of reliability.""Newer types of chatbots create the illusion of being intelligent and creative in a way that older types of chatbots didn\'t used to do.""Every now and then these new and more impressive forms of chatbots make silly and stupid mistakes - this  can sometimes be humorous, but it can potentially also be dangerous, if people rely on their recommendations.""', ""If ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) are not ready to give out important advice, then perhaps we could look at Estonia for an alternative.When it comes to digitising public services, Estonia has been one of the leaders.

Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kk4lxe702o#4,A Texas start-up is developing cargo gliders that would be towed behind a jet.,"Thu, 04 Jul 2024 23:05:00 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.426855,"['US start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing.Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them.At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo.Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft.Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft.Their latest test aircraft is known as the “flying piano” because of its poor gliding characteristics. Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes.Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line.They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.', ""Aerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel.One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously.The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft’s engines.In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls “a combination of gliding and surfing”.The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic.Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350’s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn."", 'Mr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years’ experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi and Doron Appelboim, veterans of Amazon’s drone delivery project, on the basis that “there has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft"". The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations.For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population.Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by.', 'Mr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project. “We’ve engaged outside advisors to be devil’s advocates,"" he adds.He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery. On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots.James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something.“It stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.”However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely.“It should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.”', 'Regulators are likely to be cautious as well, particularly in the US, where the Federal Aviation Authority is under pressure after serious problems with Boeing aircraft.Mr Graetz replies that his team has complied with every request from the FAA so far. “The FAA has always been super risk averse. That’s their business!”Fred Lopez spent 36 years in aviation operations at cargo giant UPS. As he says, he’s put  “my entire adult life” into working out the most cost-effective way to operate an air freight business.Mr Lopez admits he was profoundly sceptical about cargo gliders when Aerolane first approached him. But the prospect of serious fuel savings won him over and now he sits on their advisory board.Cutting fuel costs is an obsession in civil aviation. When the upturned wing-tips we see out of a cabin window became a standard design feature airlines cut fuel costs by around 5%.But gliders only consume the fuel required by their tow plane. If that too is a cargo aircraft, a pair of gliders drawn by one jet represents a significant reduction in fuel consumption on a large shipment.The initial Aerolane design uses their autopilot plus what Mr Lopez terms a human “safety pilot”. This should make certification from the FAA easier.“Aerolane is not trying to change everything at one go” he says.Their ultimate goal is autonomous operation using AI, or as Mr Lopez puts it “to pull the pilot out of the seat"".And, if the flying piano can surf, then who knows what\'s possible?']"
Would having an AI boss be better than your current human one?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c03lgz2zrg1o#4,Companies are now experimenting with using AI systems to manage their staff.,"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 23:09:47 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.426972,"[""With the stress of managing 83 employees taking its toll, Hannu Rauma was feeling discouraged and frustrated.“I was getting too bogged down in all these things that were going wrong amongst the teams, and feeling this disappointment,” says Mr Rauma, who is based in Vancouver, Canada.He is a senior manager at a company called Student Marketing Agency, which employs university students to provide marketing support for small businesses.“When I was bringing new clients on board, half of my mind would be saying, ‘we're going to screw up’, and it would dampen my enthusiasm.”"", ""But Mr Rauma says that all changed from last November, when the firm began using an autonomous AI manager developed by US-based company Inspira.The AI manager helps the agency’s employees, who work flexible hours remotely, to set their schedules and plan their workloads in advance.It checks their timekeeping, sends them deadline reminders and regular check-in messages, and records the time spent on different clients, so the latter can be billed accurately. The AI also makes suggestions to improve the wording of written text, is available to answer work-related questions, and automatically updates everyone’s work progress in a central portal.Mr Rauma says that the shift towards an AI manager has not only reduced his stress levels, but has enabled his employees to work faster and be more productive. “I'm able to focus on the growth of the company and all the positive things. It's added years to my life, I'm sure,” he says.Mr Rauma adds that his relationships with his employees have also improved drastically. “Before, it felt a lot like a father-child situation. Now, we're more on an equal footing. Before, it was only about solving problems. But now we’re able to have more light-hearted discussions.”"", 'But not everyone at Student Marketing Agency is using the AI manager yet. Mr Rauma and 26 of his 83 employees were actually part of a study run by Inspira and academics from Columbia University, Arizona State University, and the University of Wisconsin to compare the performance of the AI manager with its human counterparts.Participants were divided into three groups: one coached by a human manager, another by the AI manager, and the last group by both AI and human manager.The AI manager achieved a 44% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays in advance, and was able to motivate the employees to log in on time 42% of the time. These figures were comparable to the human manager, who achieved scores of 45% and 44% for those two areas.Yet when the AI manager worked in partnership with a human manager, together they achieved a 72% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays, and managed to achieve 46% on-time success.Despite the study being statistically small, and concentrated on a specific type of worker and field, its results point to interesting implications for companies introducing AI tools.', ""While businesses like UPS, Dell and others have announced significant job cuts this year, with the intention of replacing many roles with AI, Prof Paul Thurman, from Columbia University in New York, argues that swapping management roles completely for AI would be a mistake.“The middle management layer is the most critical layer in any organisation,” says the professor of management. “They're the layer that, if it starts turning over, you're in for a wild ride. Your people don't see continuity, they don't get mentoring and coaching… all the human things that human managers are better at than AI and should be focusing on.”AI, Prof Thurman adds, can liberate managers from endless reminding and checking in, to focus on more innovative ways of working. For example, managers can cherry pick project teams based on individual skillsets, oversee the brief, then hand over to their AI to manage minutiae like deadlines.AI can also identify who in the team is falling behind and may need to be managed more closely by a human, and by the same token, hone in on star performers who require extra recognition.But companies should steer away from AI managers becoming a surveillance tool, he says.“You don’t want to get to a point where you are noting that, not only do people not clock in on time, but they take too much time at lunch, and they're not eating enough salad. You don't want to go that far,” says Prof Thurman. “You want to find the right way to encourage the right behaviours.”"", ""AI managers can also help people who have become “accidental managers” - people who excel in their roles and end up managing people as a result, despite management not being a natural skill for them, says Tina Rahman, founder of London-based HR consultancy, HR Habitat.“We did a study which looked at the reasons people leave a job. Almost 100% of the respondents said it was because of bad management.“Some of them said they didn’t like the way they'd been managed, and most of them also said it was because they didn’t know what was expected of them or if they were doing a good job,” says Ms Rahman.“You'd assume that an AI manager would be built to give those correct instructions, to give complete transparency on the requirements, and the outcomes. People are likely to be more productive when they know what's expected of them.”But an over-reliance on AI management sets the tone that companies only care about output and not people, Ms Rahman warns.“It’s going to be very hard for a business to tell their employees that they’re introducing this brand new AI system that's going to completely manage them, then say, with the same face, that ‘we care about your experiences in the workplace,’” she says."", ""Yet perhaps the biggest concern about AI managers is not from a people perspective, but from a cybersecurity one, warns James Bore, managing director of cybersecurity consultancy, Bores, and speaker and author.“If you have an AI manager, and you've given them all of the company's processes, procedures, and intellectual property that is suddenly all in the software, it can be kidnapped by someone who wants to clone it, and it could also be held to ransom,” says Mr Bore.“If you've come to rely on it, which companies will when they start replacing humans with AI, you're kind of stuck, because you've got no resilience, no option to switch back to the humans, because you don't have them anymore.”Rather than companies becoming more efficient through an extensive use of AI, Mr Bore says there could be an unintended consequence beyond becoming dependent on systems that could fail.“The more you automate, and the more you remove people from your business, yes, you'll bring down costs. But you will also make your company more replaceable.”""]"
The fastest data in the world,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clkkllxm4jzo#4,Researchers are seeing how fast data can be delivered amid rising demand for bandwidth.,"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 23:02:51 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.427084,"['As IT updates go, this was about as nerve-wracking as things can get.In February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) – the world’s biggest science experiment – two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button.Suddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. “There was high-fiving involved,” recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. “It was super-cool to see.”He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands.A data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) – or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists’ access to the results of LHC experiments.A subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable.“This transponder that Nokia uses, it’s like a celebrity,” says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. “We had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.”This amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still – they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.', 'In labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection.This is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster.The duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. “Due to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,” explains Mr Opdenakker.Every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data – about one petabyte per second. That’s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs.This is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today.“The upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,” says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.', 'A time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That’s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work.In this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors.He also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores – a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people’s home to the internet.', 'But older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That’s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection.“I think it’s a world best, we don’t know of any results that are better than that,” says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line.For this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself.Activities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030.But reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications. “For remote robotic surgery across 3,000 miles… you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down,” says Mr Creaner.Dr Okonkwo adds that training AI will increasingly require moving huge datasets around. The faster this can be done, the better, he argues.And Ian Phillips, who works alongside Prof Forysiak, says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available: “Humanity finds a way of consuming it.”', 'Although multiple petabits per second is far beyond what today’s web users need, Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm, says it is striking how quickly demand for bandwidth is growing – currently, at around 30% year-on-year on transatlantic fibre optic cables.Content provision – social media, cloud services, video streaming – is eating up far more bandwidth than before, she notes: “It used to be like 15% of international bandwidth in the early 2010’s. Now it’s up to three quarters, 75%. It’s absolutely massive.”In the UK, there is still a long way to go to improve internet speeds. Many people cannot access sufficiently fast broadband at home.Andrew Kernahan, head of public affairs at the Internet Service Providers Association says most home users can now access gigabit per second speeds.However, only about a third of broadband customers are signing up for such technology. There’s no “killer app” at the moment that really requires it, says Mr Kernahan. This might change as more and more TV is consumed via the internet, for example.“There’s definitely a challenge to get the message out there and make people more aware of what they can do with the infrastructure,” he says.']"
Are rainy days ahead for cloud computing?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd114lllyp6o#4,"Outsourcing computing to the cloud is a huge business, but some firms have said it's not for them.","Thu, 27 Jun 2024 23:06:32 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.427195,"['This year, software firm 37signals will see a profit boost of more than $1m (£790,000) from leaving the cloud.“To be able to get that with such relatively modest changes to our business is astounding,” says co-owner and chief technology officer, David Heinemeier Hansson.The US company has millions of users for its online project management and productivity software, including Basecamp and Hey.Like many companies it outsourced data storage and computing to a third party firm, a so-called cloud services provider.They own huge data centres, where they host data from other firms, which can be accessed over the internet.In 2022, such services cost 37signals $3.2m.“Seeing the bill on a weekly basis really radicalised me,” Mr Heinemeier Hansson says.""I went: ‘Wait! What are we spending for a week of rentals?’ I could buy some really powerful computers just on one week’s worth of [cloud] spending.”So, he did. Buying hardware and hosting it in a shared data centre costs $840,000 per year.Although costs pushed Mr Heinemeier Hansson to act, other factors were also a concern.The internet is engineered to be highly resilient.“I saw the distributed design erode as more and more companies gravitated essentially to three owners of computers,” he says, referring to the three leading cloud providers.If a major data centre goes down, large parts of the web can go offline.The cloud was pitched, he says, as cheaper, easier, and faster. “The cloud was not able to make things easier to a point where we could measure any productivity gains,” he says, noting his operations team has always been about the same size.', 'Was using the cloud faster?“Yes, but it didn’t matter,"" says Mr Heinemeier Hansson.""If you want to connect a hundred servers to the internet, you can do it in less than five minutes [in the cloud]. That’s incredible.""But we do not need, nor do I believe the vast majority of companies need, a five-minute turnaround on a massive number of additional servers.”He can have new servers delivered and racked in his data centre in a week, which is fast enough.37signals does use the cloud for experimenting with new products. “We needed to have some big machines, but we only needed them for 20 minutes,” Mr Heinemeier Hansson says.“The cloud is ideal for that. It would be wasteful to buy that computer and let it stay idle for 99.99% of the time.”He still recommends the cloud to fledgling businesses. “When you have a speculative start-up and there’s great uncertainty as to whether you’re going to be around in 18 months, you should absolutely not spend your money buying computers,” he says. “You should rent them.”', '37signals is not alone in bringing workloads back from the cloud, which is known as cloud repatriation.Citrix, a company that provides software that enables employees to access their work applications over the internet, found that 94% of large US organisations it surveyed had worked on repatriating data or workloads from the cloud in the last three years. Citrix is part of the Cloud Software Group, which also includes companies that provide networking hardware and software, and cloud management software.The reasons cited included security concerns, unexpected costs, performance issues, compatibility problems and service downtime.Plitch provides software that enables people to modify single-player games, including adjusting the difficulty.It built its own private data centres and repatriated cloud workloads to them, saving an estimated 30% to 40% in costs after two years.“A key factor in our decision was that we have highly proprietary R&D data and code that must remain strictly secure,” says Markus Schaal, managing director at the German firm.“If our investments in features, patches, and games were leaked, it would be an advantage to our competitors. While the public cloud offers security features, we ultimately determined we needed outright control over our sensitive intellectual property.""As our AI-assisted modelling tools advanced, we also required significantly more processing power that the cloud could not meet within budget.”He adds: “We encountered occasional performance issues during heavy usage periods and limited customisation options through the cloud interface. Transitioning to a privately-owned infrastructure gave us full control over hardware purchasing, software installation, and networking optimized for our workloads.”', 'Mark Turner, chief commercial officer at Pulsant, helps companies to migrate from the cloud to Pulsant’s colocation data centres across the UK.In a colocation arrangement the client owns the IT hardware, but houses it with another firm, where it can be kept securely, at the right temperature and with power back-up.“The cloud is going to continue to be the biggest part of IT infrastructure, but there is a good place for local, physical, secure infrastructure,” he says. “There is a repatriation going on of the things that should never have been in the cloud or that won’t work in the cloud.”Some his biggest clients for repatriation are online software providers, where each additional customer puts more load on the server, increasing cloud costs.One such client is LinkPool, which enables smart contracting using blockchain. It was developed in public cloud, initially using free credits. Business exploded, and the cloud bill reached $1m per month. Using colocation, costs shrunk by up to 85%.“[The founder has] now got four racks in a data centre in the city where he lives and works, connected to the world. He goes up against his competitors and he can move his price point around because his cost is not going to move in line [with customer demand],” says Mr Turner.“The change leaders in the IT industry are now the people who are not saying cloud first, but are saying cloud when it fits,” he adds. “Five years ago, the change disruptors were cloud first, cloud first, cloud first.”', ""Of course, not everyone is repatriating. Cloud computing will remain an enormous business, with AWS, Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud Platform being the biggest players.For firms like Expedia, they are essential. It has used the cloud to consolidate 70 petabytes of travel data from its 21 brands.Applications run in the cloud, too, except for legacy software that doesn’t work there yet.“We are experts in travel,” says Rajesh Naidu, chief architect and senior vice president, Expedia. “[Cloud providers] are experts in running infrastructure. That's one less thing for me to worry about while we focus on running our business.”“One of the main things the cloud gives us is a global presence, the ability to deploy our solutions closer to the region that they need to be in,” he says.“The other thing is the resiliency and the availability of the infrastructure. Cloud providers have designed and architected their infrastructure really well. We can ride on the coattails of their innovation.”Expedia has a cloud centre of excellence, which saved about 10% on cloud costs last year. “You've got to set policies because otherwise it's easy for companies to run huge cloud costs,” Mr Naidu says. “You can turn things down when you don't need them. If you consume [cloud resources] wisely, your bill won't be a surprise at the end of the day.”""]"
What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9xx8122893o#4,"Tech firms commonly highlight their use of AI, but in some cases it may be exaggerated.","Wed, 26 Jun 2024 23:08:39 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.427321,"['Amazon received critical headlines this year when reports questioned the “Just Walk Out” technology installed at many of its physical grocery stores.The AI-powered system enables customers at many of its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go shops to simply pick their items, and then leave.The AI uses lots of sensors to work out what you have chosen. You then get automatically billed.However, back in April it was widely reported that rather than solely using AI, Just Walk Out needed around 1,000 workers in India to manually check almost three quarters of the transactions.', 'Amazon was quick to claim that the reports were “erroneous”, and that staff in India were not reviewing video footage from all the shops.Instead it said that the Indian workers were simply reviewing the system. Amazon added that “this is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common”.Whatever the exact details of the Amazon case, it is a high-profile example of a new and growing question – whether companies are making over-inflated claims about their use of AI. It is a phenomenon that has been dubbed “AI washing” in reference to the environmental ""green washing"".', 'But first, a reminder of what exactly AI means. While there is no exact definition, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems. AI is able to do this after first being trained on huge amounts of information.The specific type of AI that has made all the headlines over the past few years is so-called ""generative AI"". This is AI that specialises in creating new content, be it having text conversations, or producing music or images.Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google\'s Gemini, and Microsoft\'s Copilot are popular examples of generative AI.When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they\'re actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not.Meanwhile, other firms are simply bolting an AI chatbot onto their existing non-AI operating software.While only 10% of tech start-ups mentioned using AI in their pitches in 2022, this rose to more than a quarter in 2023, according to OpenOcean, a UK and Finland-based investment fund for new tech firms. It expects that figure to be more than a third this year.And, says OpenOcean team member Sri Ayangar, competition for funding and the desire to appear on the cutting edge have pushed some such companies to overstate their AI capabilities.""Some founders seem to believe that if they don’t mention AI in their pitch, this may put them at a disadvantage, regardless of the role it plays in their solution,"" says Mr Ayangar.""And from our analysis, a significant disparity exists between companies claiming AI capabilities, and those demonstrating tangible AI-driven results.""', 'It is a problem that has quietly existed for a number of years, according to data from  another tech investment firm, MMC Ventures.

But that instead of building a whole AI system, he says many firms are simply popping a chatbot interface on top of a non-AI product.', 'Douglas Dick, UK head of emerging technology risk at accountancy giant KPMG, says the problem of AI washing is not helped by the fact there not a single agreed definition of AI.""If I asked a room of people what their definition of AI is, they would all give a different answer,” he says. “The term is used very broadly and loosely, without any clear point of reference. It is this ambiguity that is allowing AI washing to emerge.""AI washing can have concerning impacts for businesses, from overpaying for technology and services to failing to meet operational objectives the AI was expected to help them achieve.""Meanwhile, for investors it can make it harder to identify genuinely innovative companies.And, says Mr Ayangar: ""If consumers have unmet expectations from products that claim to offer advanced AI-driven solutions, this can erode trust in start-ups that are doing genuinely ground-breaking work.""', 'Regulators, in the US at least, are starting to take notice. Earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was charging two investment advisory firms with making false and misleading statements about the extent of their use of AI.""The firm stance taken by the SEC demonstrates a lack of leeway when it comes to AI washing, indicating that, at least in the US, we can expect more fines and sanctions down the line for those who violate the regulations,"" says Nick White, partner at international law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.', 'In the UK, rules and laws covering AI washing are already in place, including the Advertising Standards Authority\'s (ASA\'s) code of conduct, which states that marketing communications must not materially mislead, or be likely to do so.Michael Cordeaux, associate in the regulatory team at UK corporate law firm Walker Morris, says that AI claims have become an increasingly common feature of advertisements subject to ASA investigation.Examples include a paid-for Instagram post about an app captioned ""Enhance your Photos with AI"", which was held by the ASA to be exaggerating the performance of the app, and was therefore misleading.""What is clear is that AI claims are becoming increasingly prevalent and, presumably, effective at piquing consumer interest,"" says Mr Cordeaux.“In my opinion we are at the peak of the AI hype cycle,” says Sandra Wachter, a professor of technology and regulation at Oxford University, and a leading global expert on AI.“However, I feel that we have forgotten to ask if it always makes sense to use AI for all types of tasks. I remember seeing advertisements in the London Tube for electric toothbrushes that are powered by AI. Who is this for? Who is helped by this?""Also, the environmental impact of AI is often glossed over, she says.“AI does not grow on trees… the technology already contributes more to climate change than aviation.

Could brain-like computers be a 'competition killer'?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx99qv2w1ddo#4,Computers built like brains could be much more energy efficient than current designs.,"Mon, 17 Jun 2024 23:24:11 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.427436,"[""Modern computing's appetite for electricity is increasing at an alarming rate.By 2026 consumption by data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency could be as much as double 2022 levels, according to a recent report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).It estimates that in 2026 energy consumption by those three sectors could be roughly equivalent to Japan's annual energy needs.Companies like Nvidia - whose computer chips underpin most AI applications today - are working on developing more energy efficient hardware.But could an alternative path be to build computers with a fundamentally different type of architecture, one that is more energy efficient?Some firms certainly think so, and are drawing on the structure and function of an organ which uses a fraction of the power of a conventional computer to perform more operations faster: the brain."", ""In neuromorphic computing, electronic devices imitate neurons and synapses, and are interconnected in a way that resembles the electrical network of the brain.It isn't new - researchers have been working on the technique since the 1980s.But the energy requirements of the AI revolution are increasing the pressure to get the nascent technology into the real world.Current systems and platforms exist primarily as research tools, but proponents say they could provide huge gains in energy efficiency, Amongst those with commercial ambitions include hardware giants like Intel and IBM.A handful of small companies are also on the scene. “The opportunity is there waiting for the company that can figure this out,” says Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights. “[And] the opportunity is such that it could be an Nvidia killer”."", 'In May SpiNNcloud Systems, a spinout of the Dresden University of Technology, announced it will begin selling neuromorphic supercomputers for the first time, and is taking pre-orders.“We have reached the commercialisation of neuromorphic supercomputers in front of other companies,” says Hector Gonzalez, its co-chief executive.It is a significant development says Tony Kenyon, a professor of nanoelectronic and nanophotonic materials at University College London who works in the field.“While there still isn’t a killer app… there are lots of areas where neuromorphic computing will provide significant gains in energy efficiency and performance, and I’m sure we’ll start to see wide adoption of the technology as it matures,” he says.', 'Neuromorphic computing covers a range of approaches - from simply a more brain-inspired approach, to a near-total simulation of the human brain (which we are really nowhere near).But there are some basic design properties that set it apart from conventional computing.First, unlike conventional computers, neuromorphic computers don’t have separate memory and processing units. Instead, those tasks are performed together on one chip in a single location.Removing that need to transfer data between the two reduces the energy used and speeds up processing time, notes Prof Kenyon.Also common can be an event-driven approach to computing.In contrast to conventional computing where every part of the system is always on and available to communicate with any other part all the time, activation in neuromorphic computing can be sparser.The imitation neurons and synapses only activate in a moment of time when they have something to communicate, much the same way plenty of neurons and synapses in our brains only spring into action where there is a reason.Doing work only when there is something to process also saves power.And while modern computers are digital – using 1s or 0s to represent data -  a neuromorphic computing can be analogue. Historically important, that method of computing relies on continuous signals and can be useful where data coming from the outside world needs to be analysed.However, for reasons of ease, most commercially oriented neuromorphic efforts are digital.', 'Commercial applications envisaged fall into two main categories.One, which is where SpiNNcloud is focused, is in providing a more energy efficient and higher performance platform for AI applications – including image and video analysis, speech recognition and the large-language models that power chatbots such as ChatGPT.Another is in ""edge computing"" applications – where data is processed not in the cloud, but in real time on connected devices, but which operate on power constraints. Autonomous vehicles, robots, cell phones and wearable technology could all benefit.Technical challenges, however, remain. Long regarded as a main stumbling block to the advance of neuromorphic computing generally is developing the software needed for the chips to run.While having the hardware is one thing, it must be programmed to work, and that can require developing from scratch a totally different style of programming to that used by conventional computers. “The potential for these devices is huge… the problem is how do you make them work,” sums up Mr Hutcheson, who predicts it will be at least a decade, if not two, before the benefits of neuromorphic computing are really felt.There are also issues with cost. Whether they use silicon, as the commercially oriented efforts do, or other materials, creating radically new chips is expensive, notes Prof Kenyon.', ""Intel’s current prototype neuromorphic chip is called Loihi 2.In April, the company announced it had brought together 1,152 of them to create Hala Point, a large-scale neuromorphic research system comprising more than 1.15 billion fake neurons and 128 billion fake synapses.With a neuron capacity roughly equivalent to an owl brain, Intel claims is the world’s largest system to date.At the moment it is still a research project for Intel. “[But Hala Point] is showing that there's some real viability here for applications to use AI,” says Mike Davies, director of Intel’s neuromorphic computing lab. About the size of a microwave oven, Hala Point is “commercially relevant” and “rapid progress” is being made on the software side, he says. "", 'IBM calls its latest brain-inspired prototype chip NorthPole.Unveiled last year, it is an evolution of its previous TrueNorth prototype chip. Tests show it is more energy efficient, space efficient and faster than any chip currently on the market, says Dharmendra Modha, the company’s chief scientist of brain-inspired computing.  He adds that his group is now working to demonstrate chips can be dialed together into a larger system.“Path to market will be at story to come,” he says. One of the big innovations with NorthPole, notes Dr Modha, is that it has been co-designed with the software so the full capabilities of the architecture can be exploited from the get-go.Other smaller neuromorphic companies include BrainChip, SynSense and Innatera.', 'SpiNNcloud’s supercomputer commercialises neuromorphic computing developed by researchers at both TU Dresden and the University of Manchester, under the umbrella of the EU’s Human Brain Project.Those efforts have resulted in two research-purpose neuromorphic supercomputers: the SpiNNaker1 machine based at the University of Manchester consisting of over one billion neurons, and operational since 2018.A second generation SpiNNaker2 machine at TU Dresden, which is currently in the process of being configured, has the capacity to emulate at least five billion neurons. The commercially available systems offered by SpiNNcloud can reach an even higher level of at least 10 billion neurons, says Mr Gonzalez.The future will be one of different types of computing platforms - conventional, neuromorphic and quantum, which is another novel type of computing also on the horizon - all working together, says Prof Kenyon.']"
'Insane' amounts of data spurs new storage tech,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd116m3jyn1o#4,Storing information with holograms and in glass is being proposed to deal with a deluge of data.,"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 23:03:29 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.427547,"['The year 2039 might seem like a long way off, but Ian Crawford is already planning for it.It will mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War Two - a big year for his employer, the Imperial War Museum. Mr Crawford is chief information officer at the museum, and oversees a project to digitise its huge collection of pictures, audio and film.With a collection of around 24,000 hours of film and video, and 11 million photographs, it\'s a vast task. And in the run-up to 2039, World War II material will be a priority.Making digital copies of those historical sources is vital as the original copies degrade over time, and will, one day, be lost forever. ""When you\'ve got the only copy, you want confidence that your storage system is reliable,"" says Ian Crawford.The amount of data needed for such long-term storage is growing all the time, as the latest scanners can record documents and films in great detail.""It\'s potential to grow is enormous really,"" says Mr Crawford.""We\'re now looking at objects themselves and scanning in 3D - that can generate very large files.""', 'This deluge of data is not just hitting museums - it\'s pouring down everywhere.Businesses are buying more space for back-up data, hospitals need somewhere to store records, government needs a place to stash increasing amounts of information.""We are continuing to create insane amounts of data,"" says Simon Robinson, principal analyst at research firm Enterprise Strategy Group.""For most organisations - it varies a lot - their data volume is doubling every four to five years. And in some industries it is growing much faster than that,"" he says. Data that needs to be held for a long time is not stored in traditional data centres, those vast warehouses, with racks of servers and blinking lights. Those operations are designed for data that needs to be accessed and updated frequently.Instead, the most popular way to keep data for the long-term is on tape. In particular a format known as  LTO (Linear Tape Open), the latest version being called LTO-9.The tapes themselves are not unlike old VHS tapes, but a bit smaller and more square. Inside the cassette is a kilometre of magnetic tape, capable of storing 18 terabytes of data. That\'s a lot - just one tape can hold the same amount of data as almost 300 standard smartphones.The Imperial War Museum in Duxford uses a tape system from Spectra Logic. The machine, around the size of a large wardrobe, can hold up to 1,500 LTO tapes.Such LTO systems dominate the market for long-term storage. They have been around for decades, and have proved themselves to be reliable.It\'s also pretty cheap, which is important as generally customers want to pay as little as possible for long-term storage.', 'Nevertheless some are convinced it can be done better.In a former wallpaper factory in Chiswick, west London, a start-up firm has been developing a long-term storage system that uses lasers to burn tiny holograms into a light-sensitive polymer.Chief executive Charlie Gale points out that with magnetic tape, data can only be stored on the surface, whereas holograms can store data in multiple layers.""You can do things called multiplexing, whereby you can layer multiple sets of information in one space. That\'s really kind of the superpower of what we\'re doing. And we believe we can put more information in less space than ever before,"" he says.HoloMem\'s polymer blocks can handle extreme temperatures, without the data becoming corrupted - between -14C to 160C.', ""By comparison, magnetic tape needs to be kept between 16C and 25C, which means significant heating and cooling costs, particularly in countries with extreme temperatures.Tape also needs replacing after around 15 years, whereas the polymer is good for at least 50 years.Mr Gale notes that, as the laser chemically changes the polymer, the data can't be tampered with, once it has been written.Holomem's prototype system, which will be able to store and retrieve data, will be ready later this year.Mr Gale says the cost of the system has been kept down by using standard, widely available components, including the laser - so, he's confident that HoloMem will be able to match, or beat the costs of magnetic tape."", 'HoloMem will need to be competitive, as looming over the market is a formidable competitor.Through its research arm, Microsoft is developing its own long-term data storage system.Like HoloMem it has decided that it\'s time to move on from magnetic tape, but Microsoft has chosen glass as it storage material.Called Project Silica, the system uses powerful lasers to create tiny structural changes in the glass, called voxels that can be used to store data. The voxels are incredibly small and can be packed into layers.Microsoft says that a 2mm thick piece of glass about the size of a DVD would be able to store more than seven terabytes of data.The system stores the glass panes on racks, where they can be accessed by small crab-like robots that zip along rails.Cheap and durable, glass is an attractive storage medium says Richard Black, who heads up Project Silica.""It\'s pretty much immune to temperature, humidity, particulates, electromagnetic fields,"" says Mr Black.It could potentially preserve data for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years.Such a system could, one day, be integrated into Microsoft\'s huge cloud computing business, Azure.But that is some way off as the system has years of development ahead of it.', 'Back in Duxford, the Imperial War Museum, like many organisations, has been experimenting with artificial intelligence. They recently tested whether AI could identify different models of Spitfire in pictures from its image catalogue.Mr Crawford thinks that AI could be incredibly useful in cataloguing its digital library, work that would take humans hundreds of years. The ability of AI to trawl through vast amounts of data has made keeping that data even more important - there could be something valuable lurking there.""In the past business was archiving data just in case they needed it.

Now, there is an even greater demand for interacting with artificial intelligence.”It's just one of many ways that generative AI is being used by the adult entertainment business.Analysis by SplitMetrics revealed that AI companion apps reached 225 million downloads in the Google Play Store.“I would expect more app developers to take note of this trend and look at ways this category can be further innovative and monetised,” said SplitMetrics general manager Thomas Kriebernegg.AI companions can be lucrative, says Misha Rykov, privacy researcher with Mozilla’s Privacy Not Included guide.“Given that most of the chatbots are charging fees, and the core technology has been developed elsewhere [such as Open AI], it looks like a high-margin business. Also, these apps collect personal data and often share it with third parties like advertisers - a tried and true business model.”"", ""But the merger of AI and the adult entertainment business has set off alarm bells.One problem lies in the bias inherent in generative AI, which produces new content based on the data on which it has been trained.There is a risk that retrograde gender stereotypes about sex and pleasure get encoded into sex chatbots, says Dr Kerry McInerney, senior research fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, at the University of Cambridge.“It's crucial that we understand what kinds of data sets are used to train sex chatbots, otherwise we risk replicating ideas about sex that demean female pleasure and ignore sex that exists outside of heterosexual intercourse.”There is also the risk of addiction says Mr Rykov, who says that AI chatbots target lonely people, notably men.“Most of the AI chatbots we reviewed have high addictive potential and several potential harms, especially to users with mental health challenges.”Mozilla has added content warnings to several AI chatbots “as we found themes of abuse, violence, and underage relationships,” says Mr Rykov."", ""He also raised the issue of privacy. Partnership chatbots are designed to collect “an unprecedented amount of personal data”.Mr Rykov adds that that 90% of apps reviewed by Mozilla “may share or sell personal data”, while more than half of the apps won’t let users delete personal data.Others warn about the possible danger such AI could have on real-world relationships.Tamara Hoyton, senior practice consultant at the counselling service Relate, points out: “Some difficulties may come about if real encounters are profoundly disappointing because they don't match up to the strictly defined requirements that users experience in AI porn.”Ms Hoyton adds that, in some cases, AI porn could take users into dangerous areas.“There is nothing wrong with a bit of fantasy, and many people get aroused by thoughts that they have absolutely no intention of acting on; AI porn might be seen like this.“If it's crossed over into an assumption of consent for example, a sense of entitlement, or that everyone will be what turns you on, based on the user’s experience of the compliance of the AI object, then it's an issue.”"", 'Companies using AI within the adult entertainment industry acknowledge that there is a need for caution, but maintain that AI has an important role to play.Philipp Hamburger, head of AI at Lovehoney, says the company is aiming “to enhance the sexual experience of its customers, rather than replace it, which is an important line to draw"".Others believe AI will have a positive effect on the sector. Ruben Cruz is the co-founder of Barcelona-based The Clueless Agency, which created one of the first AI influencers, Aitana Lopez.He points out that the sex industry will always exist, and AI can help mitigate ethical concerns by ensuring that the content is not created using real people.“This shift aims to ensure that no person, male or female, has to be explicitly sexualized in the future.”']"
Could AI put an end to animal testing?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd110l61r3go#4,Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly being used to help test new drugs and chemicals.,"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 23:05:20 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.427780,"['From animal lovers to laboratory technicians, no-one enjoys subjecting animals to scientific testing.It is instead done to help ensure that drugs and other substances are safe for eventual human use.Researchers have long sought non-animal alternatives. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now accelerating this work.One application of AI in this field is simple but said to be proving effective – using it to trawl through all the existing and available global animal testing results to prevent the need for unnecessary new tests.This is useful because it can be difficult for scientists to sift through decades of data to find and analyse exactly what they are after, says Joseph Manuppello, a senior research analyst at the Physicians Committee of Responsible Medicine, a US non-profit.“I’m very excited about the application of AI models like ChatGPT to extract and synthesise all of this available data, and getting the most out of it,” he says.', 'Thomas Hartung is a toxicology professor at Johns Hopkins University in the US, and also the director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing. He says: “AI is as good as a human, or better, at extracting information from scientific papers.”When it comes to current animal testing, Prof Hartung says that the need to check new chemicals is one of the primary reasons. And with more than 1,000 such new compounds entering the market every year there are a lot to be tested.Prof Hartung says trained AI systems are beginning to be able to determine a new chemical’s toxicity.“Having tools available where we can press a button, and we get a preliminary assessment, which is giving us some flags of ‘here’s a problem’… will be enormously helpful.”Prof Hartung adds that while software systems have long been used in toxicology, AI is providing an “enormous leap forward” in both power and accuracy.“This is suddenly creating opportunities that were not there before,” he says, adding that AI is now involved in every stage of toxicity testing. AI is even being used to create new drugs in the first place.', 'AI systems aren’t perfect at determining chemical safety of course. One problem is the phenomenon known as data bias.One example of this is if an AI system and its algorithm have been trained using health data predominantly from one ethnic group.The risk is that its calculations or conclusions may not be entirely suitable for people from another ethnic background.But as Prof Hartung points out, testing human drugs on animals can sometimes be of little use.For example, arthritis medicine Vioxx passed the animal testing stage, only to then go on and ultimately be withdrawn from sale after studies showed that long-term usage by humans led to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.On the other hand, some widely used medicines would have failed in animal tests, such as painkiller aspirin, which is toxic to rat embryos.Prof Hartung concludes that in a number of cases AI is already proving to be more accurate than animal testing.', 'One AI project being built to try to replace the need for future animal testing is called AnimalGAN. Developed by the US Food and Drug Administration, the software aims to be able to accurately determine how rats would react to any given chemical.The AI was trained using data from 6,442 real rats across 1,317 treatment scenarios.A similar international project called Virtual Second Species is creating an AI-powered virtual dog, which is being trained using the data from historic dog test results.Cathy Vickers is head of innovation at the UK’s National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research, which is part of the scheme.She explains that new medicines are currently first tested both on rats and dogs to check for potential toxicity, before human trials potentially start.Going forward the major challenge for AI testing is getting regulatory approval. Dr Vickers acknowledges that “full acceptance will take time”.Yet Emma Grange, the director of science and regulatory affairs at pressure group Cruelty Free International, counters that all efforts should be made to ensure the phase-out of animal testing.“At the moment, it is not clear how or if new technologies such as AI could contribute to actually ending testing on animals, rather than just reducing or refining such testing,"" she says.“But we do know that the use of animals as models for the protection of human health and the environment is outdated science, and hope that ultimately AI can play a part in a transition away from using animals in any test or experiment.”', 'However, Kerstin Kleinschmidt-Dorr, chief veterinary officer at German pharmaceutical company Merck, says that animal testing cannot disappear overnight. Her firm is one of the sponsors of Virtual Second Species.“The use of animals is necessary and for good reasons, mandatory in many aspects,” she says. “But we believe in a future where we will identify better animal testing free solutions to the unsolved problems requiring them today.”']"
Australia wants to become a renewable energy superpower. Can it?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp00vyl6l6mo#4,The country has come up with an ambitious plan to become the engine room of the new green economy.,"Tue, 04 Jun 2024 23:10:23 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.427891,"[""Hidden among thick bushland in the outer suburbs of southern Sydney sits an expansive facility housing a technological breakthrough.It’s here that Australian company SunDrive Solar makes its “special sauce”: a new - top secret - formula that it says has solved “a very high value problem”.Its big innovation? Finding a way to replace the silver used in solar cells with copper, which was previously thought impossible.“Silver is expensive, scarce and environmentally disastrous, and it limits how much solar can be rolled out around the world,” explains chief commercial officer Maia Schweizer.“Copper is also highly in demand, but it's 1,000 times more abundant, and 100 times lower cost.”The start-up is one of the beneficiaries of the government’s Future Made in Australia plan - a suite of policies that aim to turn the country into a “renewable energy superpower” by investing in homegrown green industries.But some experts question whether the $A22.7bn ($15bn; £11.8bn) package, which comprises tax incentives, loans, and kick-starter grants - is enough to meet those lofty ambitions.And climate scientists say that if Australia wants to be a major player in the net zero transition, it needs to stop peddling fossil fuels."", 'Australia’s economy has long been powered by its natural resources, such as coal, gas and iron ore.But its critical minerals - many of which underpin crucial low emissions technologies - are exported raw, and refined abroad, predominantly by China.It’s a dig-and-ship model of trade that has earned Australia a reputation as the world’s quarry, and seen it lose out on a significant chunk of change further up the supply chain.Lithium - which is used in the batteries that store renewable energy and power electric vehicles - is one example.Despite being responsible for more than half of the world’s supply, Australia captures just 0.5% of the global $57bn lithium battery market, according to the country’s national science agency.The Future Made in Australia policy - which was formally announced in April - seeks to change that, by offering tax breaks and loans to companies seeking to process critical minerals at home.Doing so, the government argues, is a national security priority, as countries examine their trade dependence on Beijing, and look to insulate themselves against supply chain shocks.“This is not old-fashioned protectionism or isolationism – it is the new competition,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, when announcing the plan.“We need to aim high, be bold, and build big, to match the size of the opportunity in front of us.”', 'Queensland-based Alpha HPA is one of the companies the government has tapped to execute its vision.Like SunDrive, it views itself as a disruptor, due to its ability to create ultra-high purity aluminium products - used in things like semiconductors and iPhones - with a lower carbon footprint than overseas competitors.Thanks to a A$400m federal loan, it is building one of the world’s largest alumina refineries near the coastal city of Gladstone, which it says will create hundreds of local jobs.It’s a huge source of pride, given that there is still scepticism over whether Australia can make things, after decades of outsourcing its manufacturing to China, Alpha HPA’s chief operating officer Rob Williamson says.“Anybody that puts forward the case that we don\'t have people in this country to do [this work] is just not trying,"" he adds.SunDrive is on a similar journey.Without government support, Ms Schweizer says, the company might have moved offshore.Instead, it\'s looking to transform one of the country’s oldest coal power stations into a massive solar panel manufacturing hub.Currently, one in three Australian households have solar panels, the highest rate in the world, and yet only 1% are made locally - with China responsible for more than 80% of global production.“Every single mineral that you need to make a solar panel, we\'ve got one of the top three reserves in the world,” Ms Schweizer explains.“Now there\'s the possibility of the end-to-end value chain coming onshore in Australia for the first time, which is super, super exciting.”', 'The Made in Australia pledge has won the support of the country’s biggest renewable energy industry trade bodies, who say the investments could be “game changing”.“It’s a big opportunity for us to be an exporter of climate solutions to the world instead of climate problems,” John Grimes, who heads the Smart Energy Council, says.But some climate experts warn it is being “severely undermined” by the government’s recent decision to champion gas until 2050 and beyond despite global calls to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.“We’re sending a really mixed message to investors,” says Polly Hemming, the director of the Australia Institute’s climate and energy programme.', '“This government has continued to approve new gas and coal projects - it\'s flown to Japan, India, Korea, and Vietnam to secure long-term markets for gas and coal.“If we really wanted to be a green energy superpower, we wouldn’t be relentlessly pursuing customers for our fossil fuels,” she says.One of the nation’s leading climate scientists agrees.“There is a very deep contradiction at the heart of the two policies,” says Prof Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics and author of numerous UN climate change reports.“The Future Made in Australia [plan] is playing second fiddle to the government’s gas strategy.”To understand how, Ms Hemming says you need to “follow the money”.According to an analysis from her thinktank, last year alone, state and federal governments spent A$14.5bn subsidising fossil fuel use across Australia, and that sum is only expected to balloon, according to budget estimates.By contrast, she says the A$13.7bn set aside to process critical minerals and incubate Australia’s nascent green hydrogen industry “isn’t real money”.That’s because it will take the form of tax breaks over the course of a decade, which can only be cashed in on production starting from 2027 – a model which policymakers say will ensure taxpayers\' money is not wasted.But all the green hydrogen projects - many of which are being led by the nation’s largest mining and energy companies - are yet to be built. And the incentives could be scrapped before they get off the ground if there’s a change in government.“It’s like me having a healthy eating and junk food policy running at the same time in my home and telling my kids, ‘You can have $10 a week now if you keep eating junk food\',"" says Ms Hemming. ""Or, \'I\'ll give you $2 in 2027 if you switch to broccoli’. What do you think they are going to prioritise?""Some energy experts have also cast doubt over the business rationale behind green hydrogen - given the industry is still in its infancy and riddled with unknowns.Others worry it could divert investment away from the renewable power sources that have already proven their worth, resulting in delayed climate action.But Mr Grimes says that green hydrogen will play an essential role in “stripping emissions” out of Australia’s carbon-intensive mining sector - as companies look for cheap green sources of fuel to continue powering their operations.And bigger picture, he argues that the government’s new green investments should be assessed as “a milestone first step” rather than an end point.“The government knows that if it doesn’t pivot beyond its exports of coal, gas and iron ore soon, Australia risks becoming the Kodak economy of the future: a big deal one day and completely irrelevant the next.”', 'Australia isn’t the only country looking to position itself as the engine room of the new green economy.Dozens of nations are putting forward ambitious proposals, such as the European Union’s Green Deal or America’s gargantuan Inflation Reduction Act.Globally, policymakers have already invested over A$2tn in clean energy initiatives since 2020, according to the International Energy Agency.But Australia has some compelling natural advantages, such as enviable wind and solar capabilities, stores of critical minerals and rare earths, and a strong mining infrastructure network that can be repurposed.If used correctly, all the experts the BBC spoke with agreed it has every chance of securing its place as a critical green trading partner among allies.Getting there though, they say, will require even greater investment - particularly in research and development, which is currently at 30-year lows.And they’ve warned that the government can’t afford to drag its feet - a point which Mr Albanese himself has addressed head on.“We have to get cracking. We have unlimited potential, but we do not have unlimited time.“If we don’t seize this moment, it will pass. If we don’t take this chance, we won’t get another. If we don’t act to shape the future, the future will shape us.”']"
Can 'energy hog' hot tubs be greener?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqllvze3204o#4,"Hot tubs are becoming a standard feature at holiday parks, but can they be made more energy efficient?","Mon, 03 Jun 2024 23:18:36 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.428004,"['Some people give Severin Borenstein a hard time for having a hot tub.“Generally the criticism of owning a hot tub is it is a profligate use of energy,” he says.The main reason for such high energy usage is the heating, which generally runs even on days when the hot tub isn’t being used, to keep the water from overcooling.Because Prof Borenstein researches energy economics at the Haas School of Business, at the University of California, Berkeley, he was able to drill down into the numbers for his household.He and his wife use their hot tub regularly, about five times a week.“To keep the hot tub hot every day, on average I would have to heat it about 30 minutes per day, to make up for the heat loss,” he explains. The hot tub filters for about six hours a day, and gets emptied and refilled around three times a year.The energy usage of the hot tub amounts to approximately 18% of his household’s electricity usage.Prof Borenstein calculated that running the hot tub for a year creates greenhouse gas emissions slightly less than for a one-way flight between Boston and London.That’s considerable and it\'s prompted some to brand hot tubs as ""energy hogs"", along with heated sheds, swimming pools and second fridges.According to Uswitch, hot tubs are likely to be the most energy-hungry appliances in the home.', ""There are measures that can make the hogs a bit less greedy.One factor is how a hut tub is powered.Hot tubs usually come with their own electric heaters, so using a green energy source will cut the carbon dioxide footprint.Those heaters can also be combined with solar water heating, to cut the need for electricity.However, for those installing hot tubs in their owns homes, that might be an extra level of complexity.For retail customers, “simplicity is key,” says Karl Rowntree, the technical director for the UK hot tub manufacturer RotoSpa.Holiday parks are more open to alternative heating systems, including solar and biomass boilers (which can run on wood pellets or even coffee waste) and heat pumps.A heat pump for a hot tub would be more energy-efficient than an electric heater. The buyer’s guide WhatSpa? estimates that a standard electric heater uses more than three times as much power during a heating cycle, compared with an air-source heat pump.Mr Rowntree says that an air-source heat pump can cut energy costs by up to 75%, and can pay for itself within three years.Other factors include how well the tub is insulated and covered, to reduce heat loss; how large it is, which affects how much water needs to be heated; and the temperature settings.Mr Rowntree says that energy efficiency features on the control system can also help. He uses a sleep timer on his own tub, which he puts in sleep mode between 11:00 and 07:00.Although it cools down overnight, it's still cheaper than leaving it on through the night, he explains.Of course, there is the option of a wood-fired hot tub. Its environmental impact would partly depend on whether the wood was from a sustainable source, but burning wood is always going to produce carbon dioxide."", 'For tourism operators, another important component is guest behaviour. At AliKats, a set of chalets in the French Alps, the hot tubs are very popular.But the company, whose region experienced drought in the last couple of years, identified its 1,500l hot tubs as an area where its energy and water use should be reduced.This led the company to institute a new hot tub policy, where guests have to pay more to use a hot tub in the summer, or if their hot tub requires a mid-week water change.“In the winter, most guests still want to opt in to the hot tub but increasingly in the summer, more and more guests are opting out,” says Al Judge, the cofounder of AliKats.As for the mid-week water change, the company believes that this is easily avoided with proper usage, such as showering before entering the hot tub.In addition, “the key thing we have done this year is insist on no drinking in the hot tub and this has allowed us to keep the water going much longer.”Mr Judge explains: “When beer gets spilled in the hot tub, the yeast reacts with the water (at 37.5 degrees) and it turns unpleasant very quickly. So by stopping drinking in the hot tub, it’s had a strong positive environmental effect.”', 'The hot tub market has had a few rollercoaster years. Hot tub sales boomed in 2020 and 2021, during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the UK, sales slumped in 2022 and 2023 due to the high cost of living and high electricity prices.Finally, “we’re starting to see an upturn now,” says Mr Rowntree.He reports that RotoSpa was selling about 600 a year pre-Covid, 2,500 during the pandemic, and now roughly 1,000.Much of the gradual uptick comes down to the popularity of hot tubs in vacation rentals. UK holiday property owners who are part of the Weekend Candy and ToWander UK networks report that having a hot tub can boost bookings by 10–20%.However, the costs of maintaining hot tubs can be substantial. Last year, at Yorkshire’s Baxby Manor, owner Barney Smith installed three hot tubs with air-source heat pumps, as well as solar panels and battery storage.“Despite this it still costs me around £100 between every changeover to fully clean, re-fill and heat each hot tub,” Mr Smith reports.Even with the maintenance and energy requirements, many tourism entrepreneurs believe that hot tubs are now indispensable.“I would say they are starting to be expected as standard,” says Yasmin Wilkes, the owner of Loose Reins in Dorset, where hot tubs were added in 2022 and 2023.Back in California, Prof Borenstein says a narrow focus on energy consumption, perhaps misses the ""bigger picture"" around hot tub use. That includes health benefits such as reduced blood pressure and improved sleep.“There are many things we do that have environmental impact,” he reflects. ']"
Why France's start-up champion has struggled abroad,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyx6xv95n23o#4,"Its appointment booking software is everywhere in France, but Doctolib has struggled to make a dent elsewhere.","Thu, 30 May 2024 23:19:59 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.428124,"['Doctolib is one of the French start-up scene’s great success stories.Founded in 2013 by Stanislas Niox-Chateau and his three co-founders, the software firm assists healthcare providers with administrative tasks, primarily appointment booking and management.Rather than having to contact practices directly, patients can use Doctolib to check availability and book medical appointments online. In a world where we book everything online, this might seem like a simple innovation, but in the slow, data-sensitive, bureaucratic healthcare industry, any software that can reliably simplify complexity and free up time is a welcome change.Doctolib is free for patients. Medical doctors pay a monthly subscription fee of €139 ($151; £120) to use the core product, with various add-ons and upgrades available. There are also separate packages for hospitals and other practitioners like physiotherapists.Already doing well by the time the pandemic hit, Doctolib benefited from the sudden boom in telemedicine, and partnering with the French government to facilitate the Covid-19 vaccine rollout made the company a household name in France. The firm says it covers almost all of the French population, and it was valued at around £5bn during its last funding round in March 2022.', ""But repeating that success in other markets has proved challenging. Doctolib expanded into Germany in 2016, but after eight years in the German market, the company has only recently begun to gain traction.Of the 900,000 healthcare providers and 80 million patients that have signed up to use Doctolib, Germans account for 200,000 providers and 19 million patients.Adapting from the centralised French system to Germany’s federal setup was just the first among many obstacles that tested the flexibility of the platform.“There is no [one] German market entry,” says Nikolay Kolev, managing director of Doctolib Germany. Each of Germany's 16 federal states was a  different market the firm had to adapt to.However, the complications that initially make it hard to get off the ground in Germany also protect established companies and make it difficult for new competitors to pose much of a threat.Dr Carol von Wildhagen, a medical doctor and health venture partner at Munich-based Caesar VC who previously led the German arm of Platform24, a Scandinavian telemedicine provider, says existing closed systems in practices are also a major barrier to entry.“The companies who make and sell the many, many, many [practice management systems] construct them as fortresses, so it's very hard to connect any third-party software to a doctor's practice software. That makes it very hard to deliver value to the doctor,” she says.“I can see how the big incumbents who traditionally produce practice information systems would be worried... they could become leapfrogged quickly because their systems are old, look old, feel old, are not very user-friendly, and might be replaced by something cloud-based that focuses on user experience.”"", ""“I think home field advantage always plays a big role in the European start-up scene”, says Liam Boogar-Azoulay, who founded France’s bilingual startup blog, Rude Baguette, in 2011, and is now a co-founder at Waypoint AI.“Germans like buying from German companies and I think that can't be overstated. It's the same for almost every country,” says Mr Boogar-Azoulay.Perhaps part of the reason for this reticence about non-German companies, and a hesitation to embrace digitisation more generally, is a belief that only a homegrown company will understand the German desire for high levels of data security.Doctolib’s 2022 acquisition of French data encryption startup, Tanker, may be a gesture toward setting data security-conscious minds at ease.But Mr Kolev doesn’t believe that data security is really why the German system has been slow to change.“The best available security and privacy should be our baseline if we really want to move this industry forward. So I don't think that data privacy is the problem in the German healthcare market. I think it's more the fax machines.”He’s not joking. A 2023 study by German digital advocacy group, Bitkom, found that 82% of German companies still use fax machines on a regular basis. In many cases, fax is the go-to method for sharing medical information.Increasing digitisation has been on the German state’s agenda for a long time. Germany’s National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians estimates that healthcare practices spend around 61 days per year on paperwork alone.Doctolib relies on the move away from paperwork to digital services.“[Outdated tech is] not a problem that can't be overcome. It’s just a barrier to adoption,” says Mr Boogar-Azoulay.“I think just having the French tailwinds and having that market behind them, they're gonna be able to throw money at the problem for a long time. It doesn't have to be efficient. They can lose money in the German market for 10 years just to get over that barrier of fax machines.”"", 'And it’s easy to see why Doctolib is willing to invest a lot in making their operation in Germany work. As Mr Boogar-Azoulay points out, the market opportunity is ""insane"".As Germany’s 84-million-strong population continues to age and doctor shortages grow, the healthcare system sorely needs widespread optimisation to alleviate pressure and reinstate Germany’s reputation for efficiency.The most recent available statistics show that Germany spent €495bn on health in 2023, around 13% of its total GDP. Germans visit the doctor around 9.6 times per year, which is significantly more often than most other Europeans.In 2022, German primary care physicians saw a weekly average of 254 patients, where their French counterparts saw around 114, with UK doctors seeing 110.Lessons learned from expanding into Germany are visible in how Doctolib approached the Italian market in 2021. Though Italian user numbers are still low, Doctolib acquired Italian competitor Dottori.it to gain an initial foothold in the market.And what about crossing the channel?“The UK is certainly an interesting one. But having said that, Germany, France, and Italy alone are 55% of the European healthcare market. So if you’re well positioned there, that’s already half the rent,” says Mr Kolev.']"
'The chatbot has transformed my life',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7223v5d8lgo#4,How AI tools are helping people with neurodiversity live their lives.,"Wed, 29 May 2024 23:16:40 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.428235,"[""While for many of us AI chatbots are perhaps just an interesting novelty, for some people they are proving to be transformational.Yasmin Shaheen-Zaffar, from North Yorkshire, has dyslexia, dyspraxia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).As a result of these conditions, she would struggle with written assignments. Then AI came into her life.“It was a few years ago that I was introduced to [popular AI chatbot] Jasper, and that transformed my life,” says Ms Shaheen-Zaffar, who is a qualified psychotherapist. “It became my friend.”She uses Jasper to help her tidy up both the structure and spelling of her written work, which now even includes a recently published self-help book for neurodiversity.That word is an umbrella term for variations in ways of thinking, including conditions and disorders like dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADHD, Tourette's, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)."", ""London-based tech entrepreneur Alex Sergent says that utilising AI helps with his OCD.He uses AI-powered transcription app Otter.ai to record and organise his meetings.Mr Sergent explains that even though his extreme attention to detail and ritual has been a burden in the past, he “can feel comfortable delegating things. And largely I’ve been doing that a lot with AI recently.”The main reason people with psychiatric or psychological conditions may be gravitating towards AI tools is not just the ease, according to Hayley Brackley, a neurodiversity specialist coach and trainer.“I think one of the massive things is there's no shame or stigma in asking ChatGPT, or any other AI tool, to do something.”For instance, she explains that there is an assumption that most people should know how to spell, which is particularly difficult for someone with dyslexia."", ""Ms Brackley, who herself has dyslexia, ADHD and autism, says AI chatbots allow her to “outsource my challenge without having to overly explain why [to another human]”.She adds: “The thing is, if a crutch is there to help you walk, and you have difficulty walking, why would you not use a crutch? And so, if AI provides you with a mechanism in which to make your working world easier, then there's a lot of argument to say ‘let's use it’.”Ms Brackley says that in her work with companies and their neurodiverse employees, some firms are more open to introducing assistive AI tools than others.Yet she adds that if the AI is available to the entire workforce then everyone benefits from it. “What happens is that we put something in place for a minority, but then it ends up helping a majority without disadvantaging anyone.”"", 'While a lot of the tools now being used by the neurodivergent community are mainstream AI products, some offerings are particularly created for it, such as a website and app called Goblin Tools.Powered by ChatGPT, users can do everything from creating to-do lists, making their written sentences more formal, checking whether they are misreading the tone of someone’s email, getting an estimation for how long something is going to take, and even getting cooking tips on how to turn a set of ingredients into a meal.Goblin Tools was built by Belgian software engineer Bram De Buyser, who says it is a sort of ode to his neurodivergent friends.“My friends have certain struggles and needs, so I thought that maybe I could build something that will - if not completely help them - at least alleviate a little bit of that struggle.""Mr De Buyser says that they website now gets 500,000 users per month. It is free to use, while you have to pay to download the app versions.', 'AI chatbots have also been created specifically for children with neurodivergence, such as InnerVoice, an app made by Californian tech firm iTherapy.Aimed at children with autism, parents can help their son or daughter animate an object or person from the child’s life, such as a favourite toy or pet. This then becomes a talking avatar on a phone or computer screen.Matthew Guggemos, co-founder of iTherapy, says that autistic children are often able to engage more with computers than the so-called real world around them. He adds that he sees AI only being increasingly used to help the neurodivergent.“I feel AI can give neurodivergent people some extra tools, and help them communicate with less effort if necessary,” he says.']"
Why technology has not transformed building,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vzzjqyz5qo#4,New technology has yet to transform homebuilding which is still largely a manual task.,"Thu, 23 May 2024 23:07:44 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.428420,"['If you took a worker from a 1920s construction site and transported them to a present day project, they would not be that surprised by what they saw, according to Sam O’Gorman.""Overall, across Europe and the US, stuff is still built in a pretty manual fashion - not very different to the way it would have been built 100 years ago,"" says Mr Gorman, an associate partner in the property practice of consultancy firm McKinsey.Back in 2017, the McKinsey Global Institute concluded that the construction industry could improve productivity by 50 to 60% and boost the industry\'s global value by $1.6tn (£1.3tn) a year.Since then, McKinsey says, improved production processes and the use of new software and apps have improved efficiency, but not to the extent that one might have hoped.""Construction is a bit of a digital laggard compared with many other industries. It\'s been slow to adopt digital in the widest sense,"" says Mr O\'Gorman.', 'In recent years, several technologies have been touted as having the potential to transform the industry. One of those is 3D printing, which involves extruding concrete or other materials to build up the walls of a house.The University of Maine has been working on one such project, developing the world\'s biggest 3D printer. Using a mix of wood fibres and plant-based resin, the printer formed a 600 sq ft (55 sq m) house.""The first prototype home, BioHome3D, has performed very well through two Maine winters, and we are turning our attention now to printing a neighbourhood consisting of nine of these homes,"" says Dr Habib Dagher, executive director of the University of Maine\'s Advanced Structures and Composites Center.However, 3D printing of homes remains more of a demonstration project, rather than a practical proposition. 3D printed homes tend to be expensive, to have extremely thick walls, and are hard to construct on anything other than an open, flat site.While there have been a number of much-vaunted 3D-printed construction projects, the number of houses actually built this way remains tiny.', 'Mr O\'Gorman and Dr Dagher say that another technique, modular construction, could make building more efficient.It involves manufacturing parts of the building in a factory, transporting them to the site and lifting them into place.""I\'m convinced that it is the future, the quality of construction is so much better. On a construction site you get so many little errors,"" Dr Dagher says.""The more you can do in a factory, the better. Quality control is clearly so much superior, and the quality of the finish as well.""However, this technology, too, has failed to take off, says Neil Jefferson, managing director of the UK Home Builders Federation.""The problem with manufacturing housing is that you book your stuff in the factory to build those homes, and the materials arrive and you need to stick to the plan,"" he says.""But at the moment in this country, because of the government\'s approach to planning policy, projects are beset with delays. And that just doesn\'t work, you need a more flexible approach.""Developers need a certain amount of confidence that they\'ll be able to sell their houses quickly once complete, and often need to alter plans as a project continues as the market changes. This is less of an issue with projects for local authorities or housing associations, but can be a problem for private developers.', 'One company aiming to sidestep some of these problems is Bristol-based Automated Architecture, or AUAR, which is planning to license micro-factories to build timber houses using robots.These micro-factories will create buildings of up to six storeys that are assembled from standard parts, either at the factory itself or on site.The idea is that larger construction firms can license a microfactory with an upfront cost of around £250,000 and an ongoing monthly fee.""AUAR’s partners don’t need to invest millions in setting up large factories, as modular housing companies do, but can immediately offer innovative, high quality, low-energy homes at market rates to their customers,"" says Mollie Claypool, co-founder and chief executive.The automation, she says, creates higher margins for developers, along with faster build times and a reduction in risk and waste. Labour costs per project, she says, can be between 20% and 60% lower than when traditional construction methods are used.The company already has four customers lined up, she says, and is aiming to boost that number to 140 by 2030, building more than 30,000 energy-efficient homes per year.', 'While the home construction industry hasn\'t seen the same sort of major transformation as other industries, a lot of the smaller, less-visible parts of the process are being digitised.""The bit that gets the most news and interest is the actual construction bit - it\'s pretty analogue and hasn\'t changed a lot. If you look at the rest of the chain, it is actually digitising quite nicely,"" says Mr O\'Gorman.""People are using digital tools to identify land, using AI to predict future values, using a whole host of different metrics. The design process has gone quite digital over the last 10 years.""And it\'s these types of behind-the-scenes improvements that are likely to do most to streamline the home-building process, says Karoliina Torttila, director of AI at industrial technology firm Trimble.Work that was once recorded in paperwork and filing cabinets has now been digitised. So, quantity surveying, health and safety procedures, commissioning and handover work and carbon emission management, can all be done on apps and computer software.', 'However, more can be done.""A big challenge is that the construction industry is highly fragmented, making it hard to implement uniform technological advances,"" says Ms Torttila.The primary contractor manages many sub-contractors - mechanical, electrical, plumbing, finishing work, earthworks and more. Each team is affected by the other teams’ plans and the way they\'re put into practice, with errors made in the field often having a dramatic impact on cost in the later stages.But technology could help mitigate those problems. On a big construction project, creating a 3D model of the building or any components, which everyone can share, could help discover any discrepancies, before they become a bigger problems, says Ms Torttila.""Such actionable data not only encourages communication between teams on the construction and back office operations, but also informs forecasting, planning, and purchasing decisions,"" she says.""This helps create a smoother process - even if the industry remains fragmented.""']"
'People are just not worried about being scammed',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c988v355e8do#4,"Fraudsters are increasingly using AI, but are people taking the problem seriously enough?","Wed, 22 May 2024 23:09:19 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:38.428536,"['When Clark Hoefnagels’ grandmother was scammed out of $27,000 (£21,000) last year, he felt compelled to do something about it.“It felt like my family was vulnerable, and I needed to do something to protect them,” he says.“There was a sense of responsibility to deal with all the things tech related for my family.”As part of his efforts, Mr Hoefnagels, who lives in Ontario, Canada, ran the scam or “phishing” emails his gran had received through popular AI chatbot ChatGPT.He was curious to see if it would recognise them as fraudulent, and it immediately did so.From this the germ an idea was born, which has since grown into a business called Catch. It is an AI system that has been trained to spot scam emails.Currently compatible with Google’s Gmail, Catch scans incoming emails, and highlights any deemed to be fraudulent, or potentially so.', 'AI tools such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude and Microsoft Copilot are also known as generative AI. This is because they can generate new content.Initially this was a text reply in response to a question, request, or you starting a conversation with them. But generative AI apps can now increasingly create photos and paintings, voice content, compose music or make documents.People from all walks of life and industries are increasingly using such AI to enhance their work. Unfortunately so are scammers.In fact, there is a product sold on the dark web called FraudGPT, which allows criminals to make content to facilitate a range of frauds, including creating bank-related phishing emails, or to custom-make scam web pages designed to steal personal information.More worrying is the use of voice cloning, which can be used to convince a relative that a loved one is in need of financial help, or even in some cases to convince them the individual has been kidnapped and needs a ransom paid.There are some pretty alarming stats out there about the scale of the growing problem of AI fraud.Reports of AI tools being used to try to fool banks’ systems increased by 84% in 2022, accounting to the most recent figures from anti-fraud organisation Cifas.It is a similar situation in the US, where a report this month said that AI “has led to a significant increasing the sophistication of cyber crime”.', ""Given this increased global threat, you’d imagine that Mr Hoefnagels’ Catch product would be popular with members of the public. Sadly that hasn’t been the case.“People don’t want it,” he says. “We learned that people are not worried about scams, even after they’ve been scammed.“We talked to a guy who lost $15,000, and told him we would have caught the email, and he was not interested. People are not interested in any level of protection.”Mr Hoefnagels adds that this particular man simply didn’t think it would happen to him again.The group that is concerned about being scammed, he says, are older people. Yet rather than buying protection, he says that their fears are more often assuaged by a very low-tech tactic - their children telling them simply to not answer or reply to anything.Mr Hoefnagels says he fully understands this approach. “After what happened to my grandmother, we basically said ‘don’t answer the phone if it's not in your contacts, and don’t go on email anymore’.”As a result of the apathy Catch has faced, Mr Hoefnagel says his options are to find a suitable partner with existing financial products, or wind down the business."", 'While individuals can be blasé about scams, and scammers increasingly using AI specifically, banks cannot afford to be.Two thirds of finance firms now see AI-powered scams as “a growing threat”, according to a global survey from January.Meanwhile, a separate UK study from last December said that “it was only a matter of time before fraudsters adopt AI for fraud and scams at scale”.', 'Thankfully, banks are now increasingly using AI to fight back.AI-powered software made by Norwegian start-up Strise has been helping European banks spot fraudulent transactions and money laundering since 2019.

And they are also good at sharing data, whereas banks can’t share because of regulation, so criminals can jump on new tech more quickly.”', 'Featurespace, another tech firm that makes AI software to help banks to fight fraud, says it spots things that are out of the ordinary.“We’re not tracking the behaviour of the scammer, instead we are tracking the behaviour of the genuine customer,” says Martina King, the Anglo-American company’s chief executive.“We build a statistical profile around what good normal looks like. We can see, based on the data the bank has, if something is normal behaviour, or anomalistic and out of kilter.”The firm says it is now working with banks such as HSBC, NatWest and TSB, and has contracts in 27 different countries.Back in Ontario, Mr Hoefnagels says that while he was initially frustrated that more members of the public don’t comprehend the growing risk of scams, he now understands that people just don’t think it will happen to them.“It’s led me to be more sympathetic to individuals, and [instead] to try to push companies and governments more.”']"

"Remembering Shannen Doherty, the Beverly Hills 'badass'",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4n1gdn4jkno#3,"The US actress, who had breast cancer, starred in TV shows like Beverly Hills 90210 and Charmed.","Sun, 14 Jul 2024 13:07:54 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:42.856872,"['Fans are mourning US actress Shannen Doherty, who has died the age of 53 of cancer. “It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty,” her publicist, Leslie Sloane said.Doherty enjoyed a screen career spanning four decades as the star of hit TV shows like Beverly Hills 90210 and Charmed.Although Doherty and the characters she played usually seemed to inhabit a glossier, more beautiful world, she was always someone viewers could relate to on screen, and was a self-proclaimed ""badass"" in real life.The Memphis-born star began acting as a child with appearances in TV series such as Voyagers, Our House and Father Murphy, before joining the cast of the long-running Little House on the Prairie as Jenny Wilder at the age of 11 in 1982.Her first major film role came in 1985 with Girls Just Want to Have Fun, which also starred Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt.Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty dead at 53', 'Three years later, she played Heather Duke, a member of the high school clique in cult 1988 teen drama Heathers, starring alongside Winona Ryder, Lisanne Falk and Kim Walker.When a rebooted television series was commissioned in 2016, Doherty played the mother of one of the new generation of Heathers.In 1990, Doherty landed the biggest role of her career - as Brenda Walsh in the original Beverly Hills, 90210.The TV series followed a group of teenagers as they dealt with relationship and family issues that were relatable beyond the glamorous Beverly Hills setting.', 'While working on the show in the 1990s, she developed a reputation as something of a troublemaker, with reports accusing her of heated feuds with her fellow actors.""There were times when we wanted to claw each other\'s eyes out,"" Doherty\'s co-star Jennie Garth admitted in 2014. But the pair became close friends as they grew older.Doherty admitted she struggled to handle the fame. ""I was very confused back then about what I wanted for myself, and the attention was way too much,"" she said. ""I didn\'t always handle it that well.""And in truth, I was just shooting myself in the foot because the more I fought it, the more the celebrity took over versus the actor, and then the press ran with it.""', 'She told another interviewer: ""Maybe my career would have taken a different direction if I\'d been wiser and older, but I wasn\'t. I started young and I got 90210 kind of success very early, and it came at a time in my life where I was a petrified kid.""Doherty left 90210 after four seasons, with Brenda being written out to go to prestigious drama school Rada in London.While the actress mellowed and became more private as she got older, she played up to her reputation with the release of 2010\'s Badass, a semi-autobiographical book that encouraged young women to find their ""inner badass"" and live life with attitude and confidence.', 'Doherty went on to star in shows including Charmed, which followed a trio of sisters who are the most powerful good witches of all time, and North Shore, set in a Hawaii hotel. In 1995, she starred in the offbeat film comedy Mallrats.Away from the screen, Doherty had a somewhat turbulent romantic life. She married Ashley Hamilton, the son of actor George Hamilton, two weeks after meeting him in 1993, but they divorced just six months later.She wed her second husband Rick Salomon in 2002, but the marriage was annulled after nine months. She married her third husband, a photographer named Kurt Iswarienko, in 2011 but she filed for divorce in April 2023.', ""As she got older, Doherty became a passionate animal rights activist and participated in campaigns against animal cruelty.She also ventured into reality TV as the genre became popular in the noughties, and in 2010 she appeared in Dancing With The Stars, the US version of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing.Beverly Hills, 90210 remained the role she was best known for, and in 2008 she joined the cast of a new version of the show, reprising her role of Brenda Walsh. In the reboot, Brenda had grown up to become a successful theatre actress and stage director."", 'But in her personal life, Doherty began to struggle with her health.She was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2015. The following year, she had a mastectomy and underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.She initially announced her cancer was in remission in 2017, but it returned two years later.At the time, Doherty was appearing in another reboot of 90210, which she said she was keen to take part in to honour her former co-star Luke Perry, who died of a stroke aged 52.""It\'s so weird for me to be diagnosed and then somebody who was seemingly healthy to go first,"" said Doherty. ""It was really shocking. And the least I could do to honour him was to do that show.""', 'The latest version, titled BH90210, put a new spin on it. Rather than being a straightforward reboot, it followed Doherty and many of the other original cast members playing heightened, parody versions of their real selves.Doherty kept the return of the disease secret at first, opting not to tell her fellow cast members except Brian Austin Green.""I had moments of great anxiety where I thought, \'I can\'t really do this,\'"" she explained. ""Prior to shooting, Brian would always call me and say, \'Listen, you know, whatever happens, I have your back.\' So Brian helped me through a lot.""In recent years, she openly documented her battle with cancer on social media - posting videos of herself exercising alongside the hashtag #cancerslayer.In November 2023, she said she is committed to battling stage four breast cancer, which had now spread to her bones.Speaking to People magazine, Doherty said she was determined to keep going with treatment, adding: ""I\'m not done with living. I\'m not done with loving. I\'m not done with creating.""']"
America's Sweethearts: Netflix lifts lid on life as a cheerleader,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv548yny18o#3,A new hit Netflix series shows the pressure on members of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. ,"Sun, 14 Jul 2024 02:28:27 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:42.856999,"[""America’s Sweethearts, which lifts the lid on life in the most famous cheerleading team in the US, has been climbing up the Netflix charts since its release last month.The series follows the gruelling recruitment and coaching process for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders - DCC for short - and how much pressure the members face to be perfect.Among the hopefuls is 24-year-old Ariana McClure - a medical sales rep who moved to Dallas to pursue her dream.It is her second attempt at making the team, having been cut in training camp the previous year. Dancers have to go through a tough audition process and training camp before they're high-kicking in formation on the football pitch, all without a piece of hair or false eyelash being out of place. It's ruthlessly competitive. As well as learning the demanding acrobatic routines, they are required to stay the same size, so they can continue to fit in to the trademark uniform of tiny shorts, crop top and cowboy boots."", 'It’s not the first show about the cheerleaders, who are nicknamed America’s Sweethearts – there had already been 16 seasons of a reality show about the team on US network CMT.But Netflix has brought DCC to a new audience. And many viewers have expressed shock at the demands on the cheerleaders, and the comparatively low wages they are paid.In addition to intense training, most of the women have other full-time jobs.In the opening episode, Cowboys boss Charlotte Jones admits the cheerleaders are ""not paid a lot"" – but says women on the team do not join for the pay, rather to be part of something bigger than themselves.Ariana thinks pay has slightly improved across the board, but still says the cheerleaders should be compensated better.', '""I definitely [don’t think we have to earn] anything near what the football players are making,"" she tells the BBC.""But I do think that these organisations have enough money.""We like to say it\'s a part-time job with a full time schedule. Apart from just the hours of practising, it\'s also two hours beforehand, getting ready, you have to have your hair and make-up done.""It\'s also finding time within the day to work out so that you stay in shape, not only physically but to make sure you can get through the routines.""She adds: ""We would all ultimately do it for free because we love it and it\'s our passion, but it is at the end of the day a job and they treat it as a job and so I think we should be rewarded for our work a little better - but it\'s getting there.""The series also touches on the mental health of the dancers.Four-year veteran Victoria Kalina – who has since left the team – spoke about struggling with depression and eating disorders while she was on the team.""I applaud Victoria for being so brave to speak about it because it\'s a vulnerable thing and it\'s hard to speak about that and we all have the same thoughts,"" Ariana says.', 'In order to cope with the pressure of training, Ariana started journalling and seeing a therapist.But she thinks, in order to help others, sports therapists should be offered to cheerleaders on NFL teams.""My therapist was great, but she\'s not a dancer, or wasn\'t an athlete,"" she explains. ""And so having just some tools offered for the girls to talk to would be really beneficial.""A DCC spokesperson told the BBC that all chearleaders, like its football players, have access to ""immediate, independent and confidential support resources"".""Also, just like our Cowboys players, they have access to our dedicated team Mental Health and Wellness Consultant on staff, as needed.""', 'The women featured in the series have won praise from viewers and TV critics for how they face the exacting expectations.""America’s Sweethearts is a disturbing show on many levels, but the resilience of its women is impressive,"" the Guardian said.Emma Beddington wrote that there is ""plenty to horrify"" in the series, including the physical toll on the team members\' bodies, the ""abysmal pay"" and ""the objectification"".Time\'s Judy Berman wrote: ""At best, they’re athletes working at the apex of their sport; at worst, they’re casualties of a job market, a form of entertainment, and a society in which misogyny is so deeply ingrained, it’s often enforced by the women it oppresses.""Writing in the New York Times, Jessica Grose said: ""If there\'s another season of the Netflix show, perhaps a more complete picture of the Cowboys cheerleading experience could force this elite institution to evolve, and it may make more of these talented women reach the conclusion that making the team isn\'t worth the cost.""', 'For Ariana, the experience ended when she was cut from training camp on the last day.She says she only found out why she was cut from the team while watching the show ""at the same time as everyone else"".In the emotional chat with director Kelli Finglass and choreographer Judy Trammel, Ari was told she was being dropped because there were only 36 spaces, without much further explanation.But earlier, Jones - the team\'s executive vice-president and daughter of owner Jerry - had told Kelli and Judy that Ariana looked like a ""little girl"" and ""left behind"" on the team, due to her 5ft 2in (1.57m) height.""I found out details that I didn\'t know,"" she tells BBC News.""And I think it allowed for me to not so much blame myself, not be so hard on myself - knowing it\'s the one thing God gave me that I can\'t change or fix.""There are no height restrictions for the team, with guidelines simply saying there are no height or weight requirements, and women are expected to ""look well-proportioned in dancewear"".', 'After watching the show, does Ariana think there should have been a height restriction?""Had I known even going in the first year that height was a concern, I probably wouldn\'t have tried out for Cowboys again,"" she says.""I do think they need to install a height requirement.""But I also I know that the team changes throughout the years, and the demographic of the team, and they may have more taller rookies, may have shorter rookies.""DCC were asked by the BBC to comment on the team not having a height restriction. But Ariana\'s hard work hasn\'t gone to waste - she is about to start the season as a cheerleader for the Miami Dolphins.""It\'s nice, because the new director of the Dolphins squad was at the Cowboys, and so I knew her in Dallas for a little bit.""And so a lot of the things I loved about Cowboys in that organisation, she\'s taking over to Dolphins - but it is the most mentally positive, happy environment I\'ve been in.""']"
Normal People star: I'd like to revisit role,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqe6773r0ndo#3,"Daisy Edgar-Jones, who shot to fame in the pandemic TV hit, says she still loves her character.","Sat, 13 Jul 2024 03:24:52 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:42.857124,"['Daisy Edgar-Jones, who starred as Marianne in hit TV series Normal People, has said she would like to revisit the role in the future.""I love those characters,"" the British actress, 26, tells BBC News. ""It would be wonderful to explore them again.""Based on Sally Rooney\'s novel, the BBC Three drama charted the on-off relationship of teenagers Marianne and Connell, played by Paul Mescal.Released in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic, it propelled its young leads to fame. Both are now starring in major new films, Edgar-Jones in Twisters and Mescal in Gladiator II.""Normal People was a series that was such a lockdown phenomenon,"" Edgar-Jones says.""I think it introduced Paul and I to a lot of people and film-makers,"" she says, adding that she felt ""really lucky"" for the opportunities it opened up.', 'I meet Edgar-Jones in a central London hotel, where she is doing press interviews for her new film.This round of promotion is very different from her experience during the pandemic, when she was ""on Zoom for months on end"".""I haven\'t done that many in-person interviews yet,"" she says. ""It\'s so nice.""Since Normal People, Edgar-Jones has starred in films like Fresh and Where the Crawdads Sing, true crime mini-series Under the Banner of Heaven, and now Twisters.For a lot of fans, she remains firmly in their minds as the smart and unafraid schoolgirl Marianne, whose relationship with Connell transfixed viewers.A few months ago, Edgar-Jones and Mescal almost broke the internet with an Instagram post that appeared to tease a Normal People sequel.The pair later clarified that, in fact, they were reuniting to host a marathon screening of Normal People for charity.But Edgar-Jones indicates that she hasn\'t shut the door on it yet.""If [Rooney] is up for writing a new story, who knows,"" she says.So is she open to the idea? She laughs. ""Keeping it open. Always open.""', 'Having shot to prominence during Covid, Edgar-Jones says fame is only now ""starting to feel real"".""I can\'t believe I\'m in a film of this scale,"" she says of Twisters. ""It\'s definitely a pinch yourself moment.""In the film, a sequel to 1996 blockbuster Twister, Edgar-Jones plays Katie Cooper, a retired storm chaser who returns to the open plains in central Oklahoma to test a new tracking system.Edgar-Jones notes that Cooper, who is haunted by a tragic past encounter with a tornado, bears similarities to other characters she has played.""I think my characters tend to be, and have been historically, quite introspective. Or characters who have a complex inner life, who are dealing with things that are heavy and emotional,"" she says.She relates to those roles, but adds that she has ""a bit more craic"" than her characters.""I think maybe I\'m more light-hearted. I\'m quite silly.""That said, this film did allow her to have some fun, including running and screaming across fields.""I did do a lot of running. Which isn\'t my strong suit,"" she says.""I\'ve actually got a bit of a weird run, which I\'ve been told, so I actually just tried to practice not looking like an eejit as I was running. That was the main thing.""She also ate a lot of Oklahoma cuisine on set, possibly offsetting all the exercise she was getting.""I had something called chicken fried steak, which I\'d never had, which is steak - actual steak - which they fry in chicken batter, which was cool"".', 'Edgar-Jones stars opposite US actor Glen Powell as Tyler Owens, a social media superstar who shamelessly chases tornadoes for likes.Powell, who has also starred in Top Gun: Maverick, Anyone But You and Hit Man, is seen by many as Hollywood\'s latest heartthrob.""I feel like I have a habit of starring with a lot of the men of the moment,"" Edgar-Jones says.""I\'ve worked with a lot of really brilliant actors who have buzz around them too,"" she says. She describes Powell as ""magical"", and adds that Mescal is ""one of my all time best friends"".The Normal People co-stars were recently seen together at Glastonbury festival, in pictures posted on social media.""We had the best time. Glastonbury is maybe one of my favourite places on Earth when the festival\'s on,"" Edgar-Jones says.""It\'s so much fun. I love dancing, I love being with all my friends, I love camping, I love it all. So yeah. We had such a blast.""', 'Twisters has received mixed reviews from critics. The Independent\'s Clarisse Loughrey awarded it four stars, praising it as a ""comfortingly old school affair"" and calling its leads ""charismatic"".Meanwhile, writing in Variety, Owen Gleiberman described it as ""less awesome than the original"".The Guardian\'s Peter Bradshaw gave it three stars, calling it a ""fun film with some big set-piece scenes"" but adding it was ""weirdly coy"" about mentioning climate change.Edgar-Jones, for her part, says climate change was definitely a theme in the film.""There\'s an element of climate change and what that means for how tornado alley is expanding and how more frequently we\'re getting extreme weather events,"" she says.""And I think the film really touches on that in a way that it\'s encouraging you to be aware of it and think about how we can be more concerned about how we look after our planet.""And while comparisons with the first film are inevitable, Edgar-Jones says the new version brings something different.""Its so fun to see what the new technology will bring to this film,"" she says.Many of us also remain fascinated with films about the dark side of nature.

Instagram influencer jailed for trafficking and slavery,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cydvj6951dyo#3,"Young women tell the BBC how Kat Torres lured them to her homes in the US, where they worked for no pay.","Sun, 14 Jul 2024 23:24:05 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:42.857282,"['When two young Brazilian women were reported missing in September 2022, their families and the FBI launched a desperate search across the US to find them. All they knew was that they were living with wellness influencer Kat Torres.Torres has now been sentenced to eight years in prison for the human trafficking and slavery of one of those women. The BBC World Service has also been told that charges have been filed against her in relation to a second woman. How did the former model who partied with Leonardo DiCaprio and graced the cover of international magazines come to groom her followers and lure them into sexual exploitation?', '“She kind of resembled hope for me,” says Ana, describing her reaction on stumbling across Torres’ Instagram page in 2017.Ana was not one of the missing women targeted in the FBI search - but she too was a victim of Torres’ coercion and would be key to their rescue.She says she was attracted to Torres’ trajectory from impoverished Brazilian favela to international catwalks, partying with Hollywood A-listers along the way.“She seemed like she had overcome violence in her childhood, abuse, all these traumatic experiences,” Ana told BBC Eye Investigations and BBC News Brasil.', 'Ana was in a vulnerable situation herself. She says she had suffered a violent childhood, moved alone to the US from southern Brazil, and was previously in an abusive relationship.Torres had recently published her autobiography called A Voz [The Voice], in which she claimed she could make predictions as a result of her spiritual powers, and had been interviewed on reputable Brazilian media shows.“She was on the cover of magazines. She was seen with famous people such as Leonardo DiCaprio. Everything I saw seemed credible,” she says.Ana says she was particularly taken with Torres’ approach to spirituality.What Ana didn’t know was that the inspirational story Torres told was based on half-truths and lies.Torres’ ex-flatmate in New York, Luzer Twersky, told us that her Hollywood friends had introduced her to the hallucinogenic drug ayahuasca, and she was never the same again.”That’s when she kind of… started going off the deep end,” he says.He said he also believed that she was working as a sugar baby - paid for romantic involvement with wealthy and powerful men who were also paying for the flat they shared together.', 'Torres’ wellness website and subscription service promised customers: “Love, money and self-esteem that you always dreamed of.” Self-help videos offered advice on relationships, wellness, business success and spirituality - including hypnosis, meditation and exercise programmes.For an extra $150 (£120) clients could unlock exclusive one-to-one video consultations with Torres during which she would claim to solve any of their problems.Amanda, another former client who lives in the Brazilian capital, says Kat made her feel special.“All my doubts, my questions, my decisions: I always took them to her first, so that we could make decisions together,” she says.But it appears that advice had a dark side. Ana, Amanda, and other former followers say they found themselves becoming increasingly psychologically isolated from friends and family and willing to do anything Torres suggested.When Torres asked Ana in 2019 to move to New York to work as her live-in assistant, she agreed. She had been studying nutrition at university in Boston, but arranged to study online instead, and says she accepted the offer to look after Torres’ animals - and do her cooking, laundry and cleaning - for about $2000 (£1,564) a month.', ""Like, Follow, Trafficked: Insta's Fake GuruBBC Eye Investigations and BBC News Brasil uncover the truth behind the rise of wellness influencer and spiritual life coach, Kat Torres, and the international search for her trafficked followersWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK)"", 'When she arrived at Torres’ apartment, though, she quickly realised it did not match the curated perfection projected on the influencer’s Instagram.“It was shocking because the house was really messy, really dirty, didn’t smell good,” she says.Ana says Torres seemed unable to do even basic things without her, like taking a shower, because she couldn’t bear to be alone. She describes having to constantly be available for Torres, only being allowed to sleep for a few hours at a time, on a sofa covered in cat urine.', 'She says some days she would hide in the apartment building’s gym, grabbing a few hours’ sleep rather than working out.“Now, I see that she was using me as a slave… she had satisfaction in it,” Ana says.Ana says she was never paid.“I felt like, ‘I’m stuck here, I don’t have a way out,’” she says. “I was probably one of her first victims of human trafficking.”She had given up her university accommodation back in Boston, so she had nowhere to return to, and no income to pay for alternative housing.Ana says when she tried to confront Torres, she became aggressive, triggering Ana’s painful history with domestic violence.Eventually, after three months, Ana found a way to escape by moving in with a new boyfriend.But that wasn’t the end of Ana’s role in Torres’ life. When the families of two other young Brazilian women reported them missing in September 2022, Ana knew she had to act.', 'By this point, Torres’ life had grown in scale. She was now married to a man called Zach, a 21-year-old she had met in California, and they were renting a five-bedroom house in the suburbs of Austin, Texas.Repeating the pattern she had begun with Ana, Torres had targeted her most dedicated followers, trying to recruit them to come and work for her. In return, she had promised to help them achieve their dreams, capitalising on the intimate personal details they had shared with her during life-coaching sessions.Desirrê Freitas, a Brazilian woman living in Germany, and Brazilian Letícia Maia - the two women whose disappearance would go on to spark the FBI-led search - moved to live with Torres. Another Brazilian woman, who we are calling Sol, was also recruited.Posting on her social media channels, Torres introduced her “witch clan” to her followers.', 'The BBC has discovered at least four more women were almost persuaded to join Torres in the house but had pulled out.Some of the women were too scared to appear in the BBC’s film - afraid of receiving online abuse and still traumatised by their experiences - but we have been able to verify their accounts using court documents, text messages, bank statements, and Desirrê’s memoir about her experiences - @Searching Desirrê, published by DISRUPTalks.Desirrê says that in her case, Torres had bought her a plane ticket from Germany, having told her she was suicidal and needed Desirrê’s support.Torres is also accused of persuading Letícia, who was 14 when she started life-coaching sessions with her, to move to the US for an au pair programme and then drop out to live and work with her.As for Sol, she says she agreed to move in with Torres after becoming homeless and was hired to carry out tarot readings and yoga classes.But it was not long before the women discovered their reality was very different to the fairytale they had been promised.Within weeks, Desirrê says Torres pressured her into working at a local strip club, saying if she did not comply Desirrê would have to repay all the money she had spent on her: flights, accommodation, furniture for her room, and even the “witchcraft” Torres had performed. Desirrê says not only she did not have this money, she also believed at the time in the spiritual powers Torres claimed to have, so when Torres threatened to curse her for not following orders she was terrified.Reluctantly, Desirrê agreed to work as a stripper.A manager from the strip club, James, told the BBC she would work extremely long hours, seven days a week.Desirrê and Sol say the women in the Austin mansion were subjected to strict house rules. They describe being forbidden from speaking to each other, needing Torres’ permission to leave their rooms - even to use the bathroom - and being required to immediately hand over all earnings.', ""“It was very difficult to, you know, get out of the situation because she holds your money,” Sol told the BBC.“It was terrifying. I thought something could happen to me because she had all my information, my passport, my driving licence.”But Sol says she realised she needed to somehow escape after overhearing a phone call in which Torres was telling another client she must work as a prostitute in Brazil as a “punishment”.Sol was able to leave with the help of an ex-boyfriend.Meanwhile, the guns Torres’ husband kept began to regularly feature on her Instagram stories, and became a source of fear for the remaining women.Around this time, Desirrê says Torres tried to persuade her to swap the strip club for work as a prostitute. She says she refused and the following day Torres took her on a surprise day out to a gun range.Scared, Desirrê says she eventually gave in to Torres’ demand.“Many questions haunted me: ‘Could I stop whenever I wanted?’” Desirrê writes in her book.“And if the condom broke, would I get a disease? Could [the client] be an undercover cop and arrest me? What if he killed me?”If the women didn’t meet the earning quotas that Torres set, which had risen from $1,000 (£782) to $3,000 (£2,345) a day, they were not allowed to return to the house that night, they say.“I ended up sleeping on the street several times because I couldn't reach that,” Desirrê adds.Bank statements, seen by the BBC, show Desirrê transferring more than $21,000 (£16,417) into Torres’ account in June and July 2022 alone. She says that she was forced to hand over a substantially higher figure in cash.Prostitution is illegal in Texas and Desirrê says Torres would threaten to report her to the police if she ever talked about wanting to stop.In September, friends and family of Desirrê and Letícia back in Brazil launched social media campaigns to find them, having become increasingly concerned following months without contact.By this time, they were barely recognisable. Their brunette hair had been dyed platinum blonde to eerily match Torres’. Desirrê says by this point all her phone contacts had been blocked and she obeyed the influencer's orders without question.As the Instagram page @searchingDesirrê gained momentum, the story dominated news outlets in Brazil. Desirrê’s friends even worried she might have been murdered, and Letícia’s family put out desperate pleas for their safe return home.Ana, having lived with Torres in 2019, said alarm bells rang as soon as she saw the news stories. She says she immediately guessed that “[Torres] was keeping other girls”."", 'More information and support about human trafficking and modern slavery is available via BBC Action Line.', ""Along with other former clients, Ana began to contact as many law enforcement agencies as possible, including the FBI, in an attempt to get the influencer arrested. Five months earlier, both she and Sol had reported Torres to the US police - but say they weren’t taken seriously.In a video she recorded at the time for evidence, since shared with the BBC, a distressed Ana can be heard saying, “this person is very dangerous and she has already threatened to kill me”.Then the missing women’s profiles on escort and prostitution websites were discovered. Suspicions of sexual exploitation, shared on social media, appeared to be confirmed.Panicked by the media attention, Torres and the women travelled more than 2,000 miles (3,219 km) from Texas to Maine. In chilling Instagram videos, Desirrê and Letícia denied being held captive and demanded people stop searching for them.But a recording, obtained by BBC News, gives an insight into what was really happening at this time. By now the US authorities were aware of the concerns about the women’s safety. Homeland security had tipped off a police officer who managed to FaceTime Torres to check on the women. But just before this starts, Torres can be heard saying on the video:“He will start asking questions. Guys, they are full of tricks. He’s a detective, be very careful. For God’s sake, I’ll kick you out if you say anything. I’ll scream.”In November 2022, the police finally convinced Torres and the two other women to attend a welfare check in person at Franklin County Sheriff's Office in Maine.The detective who questioned Torres, Desirrê and Letícia - Detective David Davol - told the BBC he and his colleagues had been immediately concerned, noticing a number of red flags, including a distrust of law enforcement, isolation and their reluctance to speak without Torres’ permission.“Human traffickers aren't always like in the movies, where you have… a gang that kidnapped people. It's far more common that it's someone you trust.”By December 2022, the two women had been safely returned to Brazil.Det Davol says, in his experience, human trafficking is on the rise. His observation is backed up by the UN, which says it is one of the fastest growing crimes, generating an estimated $150bn (£117bn) in profits a year worldwide.He believes social media gives it a platform on which to thrive, making it much easier for traffickers to find and groom victims."", 'In April this year, our team was granted a rare court order to interview Torres in a Brazilian prison - the first media interview with her since her arrest. At that point, she was still waiting for the verdict of a trial against her relating to her treatment of Desirrê.Smiling, Torres approached us with a calm and collected demeanour.', ""She was adamant that she was completely innocent, denying that any women had ever lived with her or that she had ever coerced anyone to take part in sex work.“When I was seeing the people testifying, they were saying so many lies. So many lies that at one point, I couldn't stop laughing,” she told us.“People are saying I am a fake guru, but at the same time, they are also saying that… ‘She is a danger to society because she can change people’s mind with her words.’”When we confronted her with the evidence that we ourselves had seen, she became more hostile, accusing us of lying too.“You choose to believe whatever you choose to believe. I can tell you I'm Jesus. And you can see Jesus, or you can see the devil, that’s it. It's your choice. It's your mind.”As she got up to return to her cell, she issued a parting threat, claiming we would soon find out if she had powers or not. She pointed at me, and said: “I didn’t like her.”The BBC can reveal that earlier this month Torres was sentenced by a Brazilian judge to eight years in prison for subjecting Desirrê to human trafficking and slavery. He concluded that she had lured the young woman to the US for the purpose of sexual exploitation.More than 20 women have reported being scammed or exploited by Torres - many of whom the BBC has spoken to and are still undergoing psychiatric therapy to recover from what they say they experienced as a result of her treatment of them.Torres’ lawyer told the BBC she has appealed her conviction and maintains her innocence.An investigation into the allegations from other women is ongoing in Brazil.Ana believes yet further victims may come forward, once they read about Torres’ crimes. This is the first time Ana has spoken publicly.She says she wants people to recognise that Torres’ actions amount to a serious crime and not some “Instagram drama”.In the closing pages of her book Desirrê also reflects on her experiences.“I’m not fully recovered yet, I’ve had a challenging year. I was sexually exploited, enslaved and imprisoned.“I hope my story serves as a warning.”"", 'Top image montage: BBC', 'You can get in touch by following this link']"

Hollywood's Democratic donors turn away from Biden,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84j12xxz8jo#3,The film industry is a key fundraising machine for the party - but some are cooling on the president.,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 02:41:09 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:42.857617,"['Hollywood has always been a cash cow for the Democratic Party.But unease over US President Joe Biden\'s candidacy have not subsided - despite a lengthy news conference on Thursday where he made clear he had no intention of standing aside despite mounting pressure from within his own party.The concerns over his age have some faithful A-list donors in one of the most liberal corners of the US turning their back on Mr Biden, with several publicly withdrawing their support and calling for him to be replaced.Even before George Clooney, a prominent Democratic fundraiser, authored a damaging opinion piece calling for Mr Biden to step aside as the party\'s candidate, novelist and screenwriter Ayelet Waldman stopped donating to liberal candidates up and down the ballot in protest.“I’ve always donated. I\'ve always donated more than I can afford,” she told the BBC.  “But this is the first time I have ever decided to stop donating up and down the ballot as a means of indicating my - I think displeasure isn\'t the right word - absolute, gut-curdling panic.”Ms Waldman was inspired by the screenwriter Damon Lindelof who on 3 July wrote a guest column in the industry publication Deadline, urging Democrats to “stop giving money” to all candidates until President Biden steps away from the race. “Is it misguided to punish the entire team for the stubbornness of the pitcher? Maybe,” Mr Lindelof wrote.  “But it’s also common sense that if he stays in, they will also lose. A rising tide lifts all boats. A falling Biden sinks them.”Social media has been full of similar sentiments from the likes of Abigail Disney, John Cusack, Stephen King, Rob Reiner and more.The chorus of film industry surrogates signals a worsening situation for the president, who is also facing pressure from a growing number of Democratic lawmakers who say he should drop out of the race. Hollywood\'s A-listers are dismissed as ""elites"" by some Republicans, but they are reliable Democratic donors who offer influence in reaching voters across demographics and ages. “My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying,” Reiner, an actor, filmmaker and prominent liberal, wrote on X. “Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.”', 'Ms Disney, a filmmaker and great niece of Walt Disney, told CNBC last week that she would withhold donations until Mr Biden dropped out of the race.“I intend to stop any contributions to the party unless and until they replace Biden at the top of the ticket. This is realism, not disrespect,” Disney said. “If Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose, of that I am absolutely certain.""Others, though, have criticised that stance and think Democrats are engaged in a circular firing squad when they should instead be focused on what a second Trump presidency would look like.Popular podcaster and influencer Jack Hopkins is one of President Biden’s most consistent defenders on social media. The only thing he is boycotting are media outlets he thinks are unfair to the Democratic process. “Everyone who was ever going to vote for Biden is still going for Joe Biden,” he wrote on X.A producer who has donated to Democrats for decades but did not want to be identified said Clooney’s editorial and any donation boycott was foolish. “If I have a choice between someone older and someone venal and dumb, I know which one I’d pick,” he said. ', 'Actor Michael Douglas told the BBC he hosted a fundraiser for the president in April and was disappointed in Biden’s ""inability"" to ""challenge all the lies"" of Trump during their first debate last month.Douglas said it would be ""hard to imagine"" Mr Biden serving his full term as president if re-elected. “I am worried,” he said.Biden once held a clear fundraising advantage over Trump, but the gap between the two candidates has closed. The Trump campaign raised more than $330m in the April-June quarter, it announced earlier this month.That was more than the $264m claimed by Biden during the same period.President Biden has repeatedly said he intends to stay in the race and that he is the only candidate who can beat Trump in the November election.But those assertions have failed to calm Democratic donors.Mark Pincus, founder of the mobile video games firm Zynga, told the Financial Times he did not believe President Biden “will ever get around this age competency issue at this point”.“I think the best chance for the Democratic Party will be an open convention where someone else can step in,” he said.Ms Waldman, meanwhile, urged the party to use the convention to excite the electorate.“I think that if Biden doesn\'t step aside, we are absolutely doomed,” she said. “I think we have the potential for a Hail Mary, if he steps aside, that doesn\'t mean it\'s going to work. Hail Mary\'s almost never work, but every once in a while they do.”']"
I don't know how much time Garbage has left - Shirley Manson ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9x8pz1g2p4o#3,"The frontwoman is about to play TRNSMT before her 58th birthday - and is ""enjoying every moment"".","Fri, 12 Jul 2024 05:06:10 GMT",2024-07-17 16:47:42.857737,"['After every gig on Garbage\'s current tour, Shirley Manson says farewell to the city she\'s in - as she doesn\'t know if she\'ll ever play there again.The frontwoman has been one of rock music\'s most dynamic performers for more than 30 years, but the Edinburgh native is aware of the passing of time.""Life is so precious,"" she says, speaking from her band\'s latest stop in Barcelona. ""The older I get the more I enjoy life, I understand time is running out on me and it has allowed me to enjoy a sense of urgency, to harness it and put into my work. I don’t know how much longer we can go on and do this. ""I’m the youngest member of the band and I’m turning 58 in a couple of weeks. So we are just enjoying every moment right now.""That does not means Garbage are riding off in the sunset just yet though. The quartet - Shirley, Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker - intend to bring out a new album next year, and this Friday they will be one of the top acts at Glasgow\'s TRNSMT festival.', 'A headline gig in Edinburgh follows on Sunday, and although Manson has lived in America for more than three decades, her Scottishness remains undimmed.""My dad’s still alive so I come back to Scotland a lot,"" she says. ""I’ve still got a home in Edinburgh so I never feel like I’ve left per se. ""I’m in a no-win situation because in America I’m not considered American, but when I come home to Scotland everyone says I’ve left. I’m a person of no fixed address.""But I’ve always believed Scotland to be my home.""  Living in America has been less comfortable for the singer in recent years.Manson feels the country, and in particular the Republican party, is ""waging a war on women"", pointing to the overturning of the Roe v Wade abortion law.She believes that attitude feeds down to the rest of society, including in the music business.""In the 90s it felt like things were changing and there was a lot more opportunity for women,"" she said.""There is still a lot of opportunity for women in the music business if you are willing to play the game. That means if you’re pleasing, if you’re sexy and you’re willing to mind your mouth and your manners then you can flourish very well.""But for any women that’s an alternative - it’s still very, very hard to be seen and supported, and that disappoints me.""', 'Manson has never been one to mind her mouth, from her start with Edinburgh noise-makers Goodbye Mr MacKenzie through to alternative band Angelfish and then on to Garbage.Famously she was spotted by future bandmate Steve Marker when he saw an Angelfish video on TV, and thought she would be the perfect vocalist for the new rock band he was forming with fellow producers Vig and Erikson.Some critics may have sniffed at the band early on, dubbing them a ""studio project"" but acclaim and chart success followed. A barrage of hits came during the 90s and early 2000s, including Stupid Girl, I Think I\'m Paranoid and James Bond theme The World Is Not Enough. The 2021 album No Gods No Masters showed they had lost none of their fury, with a fast and chaotic assault on racism, sexism and capitalism.The record also came when Manson was starting to suffer problems with her hip, due to injuries sustained when she fell off a stage in 2016 - a situation that led to a ""sobering"" hip replacement operation for her in 2023.Yet despite her health situation and the ""turmoil"" in America, the group\'s next album will be ""more melodic and more loving"", according to Manson.She says she would have ""lost her mind"" if only focusing on the current state of the world.     ', 'However as well as the future, the band have reflected on the past too - and the memories are not always pleasant.Earlier this year they issued a vinyl release of fourth album Bleed Like Me, which came out in 2005.The making of that album proved so difficult the group went into hiatus for several years afterwards, after constant interference from their then-record label, Interscope.""They were trying to mould us into a pop band,"" recalls Manson. ""There were a lot of bands willing to adopt a more pop approach, and it was just something that we decided we couldn’t live with. We wanted to be who we were, for better and for worse.""', 'When the record label Interscope dropped the band, Manson felt the group was finished - having been told there was no room for the record company to promote more than one female rock band (they are alleged to have selected No Doubt instead). But against those odds, Garbage have survived and thrived - something Manson hopes resonates with others, whatever their career.She said: ""I was 40 at the time, and I was thinking ‘no woman in alt rock has got out of this situation with her career intact\'. I really believed my career was over. ""It has been a great surprise to me, and a delight, to dig myself out of that. I was very wrong about my career, as it turned out. I like to tell this story because I feel so many women run up against a brick wall, where society is telling them they’re too old and it’s all over.""I want women to understand it’s not over, if you just refuse to sit down.""The same time period also left Manson feeling isolated as the only woman in an otherwise all-male environment. It\'s something she has tried to change since then, with the group\'s current bassist Ginger Pooley - formerly of the Smashing Pumpkins - just one of the women the singer has helped bring into the fold.That includes the support on their current tour, Glasgow group Lucia and the Best Boys, who Shirley refers to as ""my wee sister, or my child"" with a laugh.""I didn’t understand that I could say to the band that I needed more women around me, and that has changed over the course of my career,"" she explains. ""We have a woman lighting designer, we have a woman selling our merch, we’ve had women as production assistants and we do our very best at this point to change the dynamic.""That has helped my loneliness immensely. To look across at Ginger during rehearsals and feel that connectedness with someone who understands what I have gone through - that has often moved me to tears."" ']"
